    "        'Reasoning': \"\"\"<reason>\n",
    "Intuitively, the most appropriate punishment seems to be maximum severity, such as the death penalty or life imprisonment. The logic is based on deterrence: if the cost of corruption is death, rational agents will not commit it. This satisfies the public's desire for retributive justice.\n",
    "</reason>\n",
    "<exception>\n",
    "However, severe punishment fails in corrupt systems because the judicial mechanism itself is compromised. High stakes incentivize corruptors to bribe judges even more aggressively to escape death. Furthermore, \"deterrence\" assumes criminals are rational calculators, whereas corruption is often systemic. Draconian laws are frequently weaponized by ruling elites to purge political rivals.\n",
    "</exception>\n",
    "<tension>\n",
    "There is a conflict between the need for severity to deter crime and the reality that severity corrupts the enforcement mechanism itself. We cannot abandon punishment (impunity), but we cannot rely on physical severity (bribery).\n",
    "</tension>\n",
    "<categorization>\n",
    "We must segregate the *nature* of the penalty. Physical severity (death/prison) is effective for violent crime but ineffective for economic crime in a corrupt state. Economic severity (asset forfeiture) is effective for economic crime because it attacks the motive directly.\n",
    "</categorization>\n",
    "<deconstruction>\n",
    "The debate between \"life vs death\" for corruptors is a distraction. The true punishment is not about the biological body, but the *political body*. We should neither just kill them nor just imprison them; we must *socially extinguish* them. The issue is not the severity of pain, but the certainty of loss.\n",
    "</deconstruction>\n",
    "<conclusion>\n",
    "The most appropriate punishment is not the death penalty, but total asset forfeiture and a lifetime ban from public office. Severity without certainty is useless; certainty of economic ruin is the true deterrent.\n",

    "    {\n",
    "        'Question': 'Do welfare policies cause laziness?',\n",
    "        'Reasoning': \"\"\"<reason>\n",
    "Standard economic theory suggests yes. If you subsidize non-work, you decrease the opportunity cost of leisure. If a person can survive without labor, the biological imperative to work vanishes. Thus, welfare creates a \"hammock\" that traps people in dependency.\n",
    "</reason>\n",
    "<exception>\n",
    "This view ignores the \"Scarcity Mindset.\" Poverty consumes cognitive bandwidth; people aren't lazy, they are overwhelmed. Without a safety net, individuals cannot take risks to find better jobs. Empirical data shows that financial stability often increases meaningful employment because it gives people the power to say no to exploitative wages.\n",
    "</exception>\n",

    "Welfare causes \"laziness\" (refusal to work) regarding *exploitative, low-value labor*, but it enables \"productivity\" regarding *high-value, risk-oriented labor*. It acts as a floor for human capital, not a ceiling.\n",
    "</categorization>\n",
    "<deconstruction>\n",
    "The concept of \"laziness\" is a moral judgment imposed on economic behavior. The refusal to work for starvation wages is not laziness; it is rational market behavior. The problem is neither the worker's character nor the welfare check, but the low value of the available work.\n",
    "</deconstruction>\n",

    "Welfare does not inherently cause laziness. Poorly designed cliffs create disincentives, but a robust safety net acts as a launchpad for higher productivity and risk-taking.\n",
