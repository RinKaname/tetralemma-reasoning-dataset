    {
        "Question": "A systematic hedge fund uses machine learning to predict intraday price movements. What are the key challenges (overfitting, regime change, latency), and how would you address them?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nML learns patterns. Challenges: Overfitting (memorizing noise), Regime Change (past != future), Latency (execution lag kills alpha), and Transaction Costs (churn).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nStandard CV fails. Use 'Purged K-Fold'. Address latency by modeling 'Execution Probability' (Limit order fill rate). Address regime change by 'Online Learning' or 'Ensemble' of models trained on different regimes.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Signal Strength' and 'Implementation Friction'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'HFT' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe best alpha is usually 'Liquidity Provision' (Mean Reversion), not directional prediction. ML optimizes the 'Micro-Price' estimation.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFocus on 'Net P&L' optimization, not 'Accuracy'. Penalize turnover. Use hardware acceleration (FPGA) for latency.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A trend-following system generates signals based on moving average crossovers. How would you optimize the moving average periods, and what walk-forward validation would you conduct?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nOptimization: Test combinations (e.g., 10-200 day). Pick the best Sharpe. Validation: Walk-Forward. Train 2010, Test 2011. Train 2011, Test 2012.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nOptimization leads to Overfitting (Curve fitting). The best parameter (50-day) is just luck. The parameter surface should be a 'Plateau', not a 'Peak'. If 49 and 51 fail, 50 is fake.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Best Historical Fit' and 'Robust Future Performance'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Systematic Trading' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDon't use a single parameter. Use an 'Ensemble' of moving averages (20, 40, 60... 200). Average the signals. This is 'Robust Trend'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nOptimize for 'Robustness' (Average Sharpe across all parameters), not 'Peak Performance'. Walk-forward validates stability.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of risk parity. How would you construct a risk parity portfolio, and what are its historical performance characteristics?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRisk Parity allocates risk equally, not capital. Stocks are volatile, Bonds are stable. To equalize risk, you lever up the Bonds. Allocation: $w_i \propto 1/\\sigma_i$. 60/40 is dominated by Equity risk (90% of risk).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk Parity assumes negative correlation between Stocks and Bonds. In an inflationary regime (2022), correlations go positive. Both fall. The leverage kills the fund. It works in deflation, fails in stagflation.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Volatility Balance' and 'Correlation Stability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Asset Allocation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIt outperforms in 'Growth' and 'Deflation' regimes. It is short 'Inflation Volatility'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nConstruct using ERC (Equal Risk Contribution). Add Commodities/TIPS to hedge the inflation weakness. Leverage is the key risk.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A volatility arbitrage strategy shorts out-of-the-money (OTM) calls and puts. How would you manage gamma risk dynamically?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nShort Strangle. You collect premium. If market moves, you lose. Gamma risk accelerates losses. Manage by 'Delta Hedging'. Buy/Sell underlying to stay Neutral.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHedging realizes losses (Buy High, Sell Low). If realized vol > implied vol, hedging costs > premium. You lose. Dynamic hedging transforms 'Tail Risk' into 'Bleed Risk'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Theta Income' and 'Gamma Expense'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Vol Arb' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nStop hedging when losses hit a threshold (Stop Loss) or buy 'Wings' (Iron Condor) to cap Gamma. Infinite Gamma (Short squeeze) cannot be hedged dynamically (gaps).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse 'Fixed Strike' hedging grids. Balance the P&L variance against the hedging cost. Always define the ruin point.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you design a statistical arbitrage system to identify mispricings across related securities?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIdentify clusters (Sector/PCA). Regress stock R_i against R_cluster. Residual = Mispricing. Mean Revert the residual. Buy if Z < -2.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nResiduals might not be stationary (Drift). Structural breaks (M&A, new product). You need 'Orthogonal Factors' to clean the signal. Transaction costs kill small arbs.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Statistical Correlation' and 'Fundamental Divergence'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Quant Equity' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse 'Ornstein-Uhlenbeck' process to model the spread. Estimate the 'Mean Reversion Speed' (Theta). Trade only if Expected Profit > Costs.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFocus on 'Idiosyncratic' mean reversion. Hedging the market/sector beta is crucial. The alpha is in the residual.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A fund trades mean-reverting strategies across multiple asset classes. How would you identify which markets exhibit mean reversion and avoid false signals?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTest for Stationarity (ADF Test). Calculate Hurst Exponent (H). H < 0.5 = Mean Reverting. H > 0.5 = Trending. H = 0.5 = Random Walk.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHurst exponent is time-varying. Markets switch. FX is often mean reverting. Crypto is trending. Equity is mean reverting intraday, trending monthly. 'Timeframe' matters.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Universal Laws' and 'Asset Specifics'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Signal Processing' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAvoid false signals by checking 'Liquidity'. Low liquidity looks mean-reverting (bounce between bid/ask) but is just spread. Don't trade the chop.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFilter by Hurst < 0.4. Ensure the reversion is 'Economic' (Supply/Demand bounds), not just statistical noise.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of clustering in returns. How would you exploit clustering patterns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nVolatility Clustering (Mandelbrot). Large moves follow large moves. Calm follows calm. GARCH models capture this.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nExploitation: If Vol is high today, expect high Vol tomorrow. 1. Option Pricing (Forecast higher future Vol). 2. Risk Management (VaR scales up). 3. Trend Following (Trends happen in clusters).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'IID Assumption' (Random Walk) and 'Memory' (Clustering).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Econophysics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nClustering allows for 'Volatility Targeting'. Scale down when Vol is high. This improves Sharpe Ratio because Vol predicts Vol, but Vol doesn't predict Return.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse Vol Clustering to size positions. Exploiting it for *Directional* alpha is hard; exploiting it for *Risk* alpha is easy.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A systematic fund's algorithm identifies a pattern that has generated alpha for the last 5 years. What validation tests would you conduct before deploying capital?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTests: 1. Out-of-Sample (Hold-out). 2. Transaction Costs impact. 3. Robustness (Parameter sensitivity). 4. Economic Rationale (Why does it exist?).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCheck for 'Data Snooping Bias'. Did you test 1000 patterns to find this one? If so, apply Bonferroni correction (p-value / 1000). Check 'Crowding'. Is everyone else trading this?\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Backtest Performance' and 'Future Probability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Quant Due Diligence' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nRun a 'Paper Trading' period. If live performance diverts from backtest, kill it. Check correlation to known factors (is it just Beta?).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDeploy small. 'Scale in' based on live performance. The only true test is real money.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you construct a machine learning model to predict regime changes (bull/bear/sideways markets)?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTarget: Label regimes based on volatility and trend (e.g., Hidden Markov Model states). Features: VIX, Moving Averages, Macro data, Correlations. Model: Random Forest or LSTM.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRegimes are defined retrospectively. Predicting the *transition* is hard. Signals lag. A model might flicker (rapid switching). Transition matrices are unstable.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Lagged Identification' and 'Predictive Leading'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Regime Switching' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse HMM to infer the 'Latent State'. Use the probability of state (e.g., 70% chance Bear) to adjust portfolio beta continuous.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFocus on 'Volatility Regimes'. They are persistent. Directional regimes are noisy. A Vol-based regime model is actionable (sizing).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A algorithmic trading system trades 1000+ times per day with sub-second latencies. What are the infrastructure, execution, and regulatory risks?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nInfra: Co-location (latency), Hardware failure, Connectivity loss. Execution: Slippage, Adverse Selection (getting picked off), Filling liquidity gaps. Reg: 'Fat Finger' error (Market Access Rule 15c3-5), Spoofing accusations.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nGreatest risk is 'Runaway Algo' (Knight Capital). Infinite loop buying. You need 'Kill Switches' at multiple levels (Strategy, Gateway, Broker, Exchange).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Speed' (Profit) and 'Safety' (Control).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'HFT Risk' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLatency arbitrage is a winner-take-all game. If you are not the fastest, you are the prey. The cost of speed (FPGA/Microwave) is high barrier to entry.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInvest heavily in 'Pre-Trade Risk Checks' (Latency penalty is worth the safety). Monitor 'Fill Ratios'.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you design a stop-loss framework for a systematic trading strategy without inducing whipsaw losses?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFixed Stop: Exit at -2%. Problem: Whipsaw (Price hits -2% then recovers). Volatility-Adjusted Stop: Exit at -2 * ATR (Average True Range). Adapts to noise.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTime-Based Stop: If trade doesn't work in X bars, exit. Often better than price stops. Trend-Following needs wide stops. Mean Reversion needs tight stops (thesis break).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cutting Losses' and 'Giving Room'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Trade Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nStops change the distribution. They truncate the left tail but increase the 'loss frequency'. They improve the Sharpe Ratio by avoiding ruin, even if they lower total return.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse ATR-based stops. Or 'Trailing Stops' to lock in profits. Whipsaw is the cost of insurance against ruin.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A momentum strategy performs well in up markets but struggles in sideways markets. How would you modify the strategy to adapt?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMomentum buys strength. In sideways (chop), it buys tops and sells bottoms (Whipsaw). Modification: Add a 'Regime Filter' (ADX indicator or Volatility filter). Only trade when trend strength > Threshold.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFilters add lag. You miss the start of the move. Alternatively, blend with 'Mean Reversion'. When Momentum loses, Mean Reversion wins. Diversification across timeframes helps.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Trend Capture' and 'False Positive Rejection'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Strategy Design' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSideways markets are 'Mean Reverting'. A portfolio of Momentum + Mean Reversion is an 'All Weather' quant fund. Don't fix the strategy; fix the portfolio.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAdd a 'Chop Filter'. Reduce position size when Volatility is low (choppy) or correlation is low. Cash is a valid position.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of factor rotation. How would you systematically rotate between value, momentum, and quality factors?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFactors are cyclical. Value works in recovery. Momentum works in expansion. Quality works in slowdown. Rotation: Overweight the factor expected to outperform based on Macro Signals (PMI, Inflation, Rates).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMarket Timing factors is famously hard. Factors can underperform for decades (Value 2010-2020). Transaction costs of rotation erode the edge. 'Multi-Factor Diversification' (Static weights) often beats dynamic rotation.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Timing Skill' and 'Diversification Benefit'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Smart Beta' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse 'Valuation of Factors'. If Value spread is historically wide, buy Value. Mean reversion of factor spreads.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBlend factors (Diversify). Tilt slightly based on Valuation/Momentum of the factors themselves. Don't go 100% into one.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you identify and eliminate data snooping bias when developing systematic trading strategies?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSnooping = Trying 1000 rules, finding 1 that works by luck. ID: 'White's Reality Check'. Eliminate: Preregister hypothesis. Split data (Train/Validate/Test). Never look at Test data until final.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nResearchers always 'peek'. The solution is 'Deflated Sharpe Ratio' or 'Haircutting'. Assume 50% of performance is noise. Raise the bar (Sharpe > 2.0 required).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Discovery' (Trial and Error) and 'Validity' (One Shot).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Research Hygiene' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf a strategy is 'Simple' (few params) and 'Sensible' (economic reason), it is less likely to be snooped than a complex 'Black Box'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSimplicity is the best defense. Complex rules fitted to history fail. Simple rules based on anomalies persist.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A fund uses sentiment analysis from social media to generate trading signals. How would you validate the signal's predictive power?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNLP on Twitter/Reddit. Score sentiment (Pos/Neg). Correlate with next-day returns. Validation: Granger Causality (Does sentiment predict price, or price predict sentiment?).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNoise is huge. Bots, sarcasm, and hype. Sentiment might measure 'Retail Attention' (Contrarian indicator?) rather than 'Fundamental Value'. predictive power decays fast (minutes).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Alternative Data' and 'Signal Decay'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Big Data' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIsolate the 'Influencers' (Smart money?) vs 'Noise'. Use sentiment for 'Event Detection' (News break) rather than directional drift.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nValidate using 'Event Study' methodology. Does sentiment provide alpha *after* accounting for price momentum? Usually, it's a short-term volume predictor.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A macro hedge fund has a conviction that central bank policy will tighten. How would you structure a position to profit from this view?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nShort Rates. Short Treasury Futures (2Y most sensitive). Pay Fixed on IRS. Short Gold. Long Currency (USD).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf tightening causes a Recession (Hard Landing), long-end yields might *fall* (Inversion). Shorting 10Y might fail. Shorting 2Y is the pure 'Fed Policy' bet. Also, equities might crash, so buy Puts.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Policy Rate' (Short end) and 'Growth Expectation' (Long end).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Global Macro' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBest trade: Short Eurodollar Futures (SOFR futures) or OIS Swaps. This targets the policy rate directly with leverage.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nShort the 2-Year Note or Eurodollars. This captures the 'Front End' repricing. Hedge equity beta if you expect a tantrum.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the relationship between interest rates and currency moves. How would you model this relationship?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nUncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIP). High rate currency appreciates (Capital flow seeking yield). Spot return = Interest Differential. Carry Trade.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nEmpirically, UIP fails (Forward Premium Puzzle). High rate currencies often appreciate *more* than the differential (Momentum) until they crash. Modeling: Regress FX changes on Rate Differentials + Risk Sentiment (VIX).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Theory' (Arbitrage) and 'Behavior' (Carry seeking).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'FX Macro' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nFX is driven by 'Real Rates' and 'Flows'. If the Fed tightens (Real rates up), USD up. Unless debt concerns dominate (Fiscal Dominance).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLong High Rate / Short Low Rate works in 'Risk On'. In 'Risk Off', unwind kills it. Model the regime (Vol).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A fund expects stagflation. How would you position a portfolio to profit from this scenario?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStagflation = High Inflation + Low Growth. Bad for Stocks (Low growth, margin compression). Bad for Bonds (High inflation/rates). Good for Commodities (Inflation driver) and TIPS.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nGold is the classic stagflation hedge. Short Consumer Discretionary (Recession). Long Energy/Materials. Cash is better than Bonds.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Nominal Assets' (Stocks/Bonds) and 'Real Assets' (Commodities).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Asset Allocation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 60/40 portfolio dies in stagflation (Correlation = 1). You need 'Trend Following' (Managed Futures) which can short both bonds and stocks.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLong Commodities, Long TIPS, Short Stocks, Short Bonds. Cash is king for optionality.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Oil prices have declined 50% over 12 months. How would you assess whether prices are cheap or in a structural downtrend?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCheap: Look at 'Marginal Cost of Production' (Shale breakeven). If Price < Cost, supply will cut, price will rise (Mean reversion). Inventory levels (Low = Bullish).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nStructural Downtrend: EV adoption (Demand destruction). ESG capital flight. Maybe the cost curve has lowered (Tech). If demand peak is near, it's a value trap.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cyclical Supply' and 'Secular Demand'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Commodity Fundamental' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCommodities trade on marginal supply/demand. Check the 'Futures Curve'. Backwardation (Spot > Future) implies tightness (Bullish). Contango implies glut (Bearish).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIgnore price history. Look at the Curve Structure and Inventories. If Backwardated, buy. If Contango, wait.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A crude oil storage facility is at capacity. How does this affect the contango/backwardation structure of futures?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIf storage is full, Spot price collapses (negative prices in 2020). You can't store it. Futures prices remain higher (hope for future). This creates 'Super Contango'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nThe spread (Future - Spot) = Cost of Carry (Storage + Interest). If Storage cost is infinite (full), the spread goes to infinity. Contango widens massively.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Physical Constraint' and 'Paper Market'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Commodity Market Structure' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nTraders play the 'Storage Arb'. Rent a tanker, buy cheap spot, sell expensive future. Lock in risk-free profit. This buying eventually lifts Spot.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nExpect Super Contango. Avoid long front-month futures (roll cost is deadly). Short the front month, Long the back month?\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of basis trading in commodities. How would you identify mispricings?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBasis = Spot - Future (or Location A - Location B). Trading the difference. Example: WTI Midland vs WTI Cushing. Driven by pipeline constraints.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMispricing: If basis diverges from 'Transportation Cost', arb exists. If Pipeline cost is $2 but spread is $5, buy A, ship to B, sell B.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Spatial Equilibrium' and 'Logistical Constraints'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Physical Arb' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nRequires physical logistics access. Financial traders can speculate on the basis narrowing as new pipelines come online.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nMonitor infrastructure. Basis blows out when logistics break. Mean reverts when infra is fixed.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A macro fund wants to hedge inflation risk. What instruments (TIPS, commodities, etc.) would you use?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities): Direct hedge. Principal adjusts with CPI. Commodities: Historical correlation. Real Estate: Rent rises.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTIPS hedge 'Expected Inflation' but have duration risk. If rates rise (Real yields up), TIPS prices fall. Breakevens are better. Commodities are volatile. Gold is inconsistent.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Correlation' and 'Volatility/Beta'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Hedging' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nInflation Swaps (CPI Swaps) are the purest hedge. Pay Fixed, Receive CPI. No duration risk (if structured right). Illiquid for retail.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse Inflation Swaps for precision. Use Commodities for 'Upside' skew in inflation. Avoid long-duration TIPS if rates are rising.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze geopolitical events (wars, sanctions, elections) and their potential impact on markets?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIdentify transmission channels: Energy supply (Russia), Trade routes (China), Fiscal spending (Defense). First order: Shock. Second order: Policy response (Rate hikes? Stimulus?).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMarkets often overreact then revert ('Buy the invasion'). Unless the event changes 'Long Term Productivity' or 'Global Trade Architecture', it is noise. Sanctions are structural (deglobalization).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Headline Risk' and 'Structural Shift'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Macro Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nMap the 'Tail Risk'. Wars increase Volatility. Buy Vol (Straddles) rather than betting on direction. Capital flight benefits Safe Havens (USD, Gold, Swiss Franc).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPosition for Volatility. Don't predict the winner; predict the disruption. Buy Energy/Defense as hedges.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A currency is trading at a significant premium to purchasing power parity (PPP). Is it overvalued, and how would you trade this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPPP (Big Mac Index) suggests exchange rates should equalize price levels. Premium = Overvalued. Trade: Short the currency. Long the undervalued one.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPPP holds only in the *very long run* (decades). In the short run, Rates/Flows dominate. A currency can stay overvalued for 10 years if productivity/yield is high. Shorting based on PPP is the 'Widowmaker'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Economic Gravity' (PPP) and 'Capital Flows' (Carry).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'FX Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse PPP as a 'Valuation Anchor'. If deviation is extreme (>30%), the reversion potential is high. Combine with a catalyst (Rate cut, Recession).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't trade PPP alone. Wait for the trend to break. Valuation tells you *how far* it can fall, not *when*.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the carry trade concept. How would you identify profitable carry opportunities and manage carry-trade unwinding risk?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBorrow Low Yield (JPY), Buy High Yield (AUD). Earn the spread. Profit if FX is stable or AUD appreciates.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk: 'Picking up pennies in front of a steamroller'. Unwinding (Risk Off) causes JPY to spike and AUD to crash. Leverage wipes you out. Correlation goes to 1.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Yield' and 'Skewness' (Crash risk).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'FX Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCarry works in Low Vol regimes. Identification: High Interest Rate Differential / Low Implied Volatility (Sharpe of Carry). Management: Stop loss on Volatility spikes.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nExit when Volatility rises. The carry trade is short volatility. Don't be the last one out.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A country's central bank intervenes in the currency market. How would you assess the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIntervention: Buying own currency using Reserves. Sustainability depends on 'FX Reserves' vs 'Capital Outflows'. If Reserves are draining fast, they will fail (peg break).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nEffectiveness depends on 'Sterilized' vs 'Unsterilized'. Unsterilized (letting rates rise) is effective but hurts the economy. Sterilized (printing money to offset) is ineffective long term.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Market Forces' and 'Central Bank Firepower'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Central Bank Policy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSoros vs BOE. Markets have more capital than Central Banks. If fundamentals (Inflation/Deficit) are bad, intervention is an opportunity to bet against the CB.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nWatch the 'Burn Rate' of reserves. If accelerating, bet on the break. Don't fight the Fed, but do fight the EM central bank running out of dollars.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model the impact of energy prices on equity market returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nEnergy Up = Input Costs Up = Margins Down (for non-energy sectors). Bad for S&P 500 (Net Importer). Inflation rises -> Rates Up -> P/E Down.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nEnergy Sector (XLE) rises. Correlation depends on the weight of Energy in the index (High in UK/Canada, Lower in US). Also, if Energy Up is due to 'Demand' (Growth), stocks might rise. If 'Supply Shock', stocks fall.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cost Shock' and 'Growth Signal'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Macro Correlation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nRegress Sector Returns vs Oil. Consumer Discretionary is short Oil. Energy is Long. Tech is ... sensitive to rates (which Oil drives).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nOil shock is stagflationary. Generally bearish for broad indices, bullish for Energy/Commodities. Rotate sectors.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "A commodity index has been declining, but the spread between spot and futures has widened. What does this tell you?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPrices down, but Spread widening (Backwardation increases?). If Spot > Future implies tightness. If prices are falling despite tightness, it's weird. Wait, typically prices fall in Contango (Glut).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf Price Down + Spread Widens (Contango increases/Spot falls faster than Future): It's a Glut. Storage is filling.

Correlation hedging (Oil vs Corn for ethanol).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nAg is driven by Weather (Idiosyncratic). It doesn't correlate well with Macro.

Don't buy EM until the Dollar turns.\n</conclusion>"
