    {
        "Question": "A PE firm acquired a company 3 years ago at 6x EBITDA for $300M with 60% leverage. EBITDA has grown to $75M. If the exit multiple is 8x, what is the IRR?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nEntry: EBITDA $50M. Debt $180M. Equity $120M. Exit (Year 3): EBITDA $75M. EV = 8 * 75 = $600M. Assume Debt paid down to $100M (using FCF). Equity = $500M. Multiple = 500/120 = 4.1x. IRR ~ 60%.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf Debt wasn't paid down (reinvested in growth)? Debt = $180M. Equity = $420M. Multiple = 3.5x. Still huge IRR. The Multiple Expansion (6x -> 8x) drives massive returns on the levered equity.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Operational Growth' and 'Market Timing' (Multiple Expansion).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'LBO Returns' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\n3 drivers: EBITDA Growth (50 to 75), Deleveraging (180 to 100), Multiple Arb (6 to 8). All three worked here. This is a 'Home Run'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIRR is >50%. Sell now. Multiple expansion is luck; don't count on it lasting.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the relationship between exit timing and returns. How would you decide when to sell?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIRR decays with time. Doubling money in 3 years = 26% IRR. In 5 years = 15%. Sell early to boost IRR. Sell late to maximize Multiple of Money (MOIC).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nWinners run. If the company is growing 20% organic, holding it is better than finding a new deal (Reinvestment risk). Transaction costs (Banker fees) eat value. Only sell if growth slows or market is frothy.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'IRR Velocity' and 'Compounding Wealth'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Exit Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPE funds have a 'Clock' (10 year life). They *must* sell. This forced selling can hurt returns. GP incentives (Carry) usually align with IRR.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSell when the 'Next Buyer' (Strategic) can pay more than your 'Hold Value'. Or when the fund needs a win to fundraise.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company can be exited via strategic sale, secondary sale (to another PE firm), or IPO. What are the pros and cons of each?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStrategic: Highest price (Synergies). 100% cash exit. Clean. Secondary: Fast, reliable. Lower price (Financial logic). IPO: Highest valuation potential (Liquidity premium). Partial exit (Lock-up). Public scrutiny.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIPO is not an exit; it's a financing event. You are stuck with stock for 6-12 months. If market turns, you lose. Strategic sale is the only true exit. Secondary is 'Pass the Parcel'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Valuation' and 'Certainty/Liquidity'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Exit Options' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDual Track process. File for IPO to scare the Strategic into paying more. Fear of missing out drives the price.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAim for Strategic. Fallback to Secondary. IPO only if too big to be sold private ($10B+).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "An IPO is planned for a PE-backed company, but market conditions deteriorate. How would you adjust the exit timeline?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDelay. 'IPO Window' is closed. Listing in a bear market destroys value (down round). Wait for the window to reopen.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nWindow might not open for 2 years. LPs need cash. Pivot to 'Private Sale' or 'Continuation Fund'. Or IPO anyway at a discount to establish a currency for M&A (buy competitors cheap).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Market Timing' and 'Liquidity Needs'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Markets' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDon't force an IPO. A 'Broken IPO' (trading below issue) is a stigma that lasts years. Better to hold.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDelay the IPO. Explore a 'Minority Recap' or Dividend Recap to get some liquidity while waiting.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A strategic buyer emerges for a PE-backed company at 9x EBITDA. How would you evaluate this against holding for a year?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCalculate 'Hold Value'. Can you grow EBITDA or Multiple enough in 1 year to beat 9x discounted back? (Risk-adjusted). A bird in hand (9x now) is usually worth two in the bush.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf the company is about to launch a killer product or close a huge acquisition, 9x might be stealing it. Information asymmetry. The strategic knows the value.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Present Certainty' and 'Future Option Value'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIs 9x a 'Control Premium'? If yes, take it. Financial buyers rarely pay 9x. Only Strategics do.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTake the 9x unless you have a concrete path to 12x in 12 months. Greed kills deals.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"exit readiness.\" What preparation would you do pre-exit?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nClean the books (Audit). Hire a CFO. Build the 'Data Room'. Write the CIM (Confidential Information Memorandum). Segregate 'One-off' expenses (Add-backs).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nOperational readiness. Is the management team ready to present? Can they withstand diligence? Customer concentration issues resolved? Litigation settled?\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Running the Business' and 'Selling the Business'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Process' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nStart 12 months early. 'Sell-side Quality of Earnings' (QofE) report is critical. It sets the EBITDA number the buyer must argue against.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInvest in Sell-Side QofE. It pays for itself 10x by defending the purchase price.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company's leverage is still 4x at the targeted exit date. What options exist to complete the exit?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSell to another PE firm (Secondary). They can relever. Or IPO (pay down debt with proceeds). Or Dividend Recap (take cash, keep equity).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHigh leverage makes it hard to sell to a Strategic (who hates debt). It limits the buyer pool. You might have to use proceeds to pay off debt, leaving little equity value. 'Underwater Exit'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Equity Value' and 'Enterprise Value'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Exit Structuring' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf 4x is the industry norm, it's fine. If 4x is distressed, you are stuck. You might need to 'Grow into the capital structure' (Hold).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSecondary Buyout is the most likely path. Another sponsor will put in new equity to reset the leverage.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model the impact of earnout terms on exit returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nEarnout = Deferred payment contingent on EBITDA. Model: Base case (50% probability). Cash flow comes in Year 1/2. Discount it at a high rate (risk).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nEarnouts are often litigated. Sellers rarely get paid in full. Buyers manipulate EBITDA. From a PE Seller perspective, value the earnout at zero or very low. It's 'Gravy'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Headline Price' (Includes earnout) and 'Realized Price'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDon't rely on earnout to hit the Hurdle Rate. If the deal only works with the earnout, it's a bad exit.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nNegotiate for higher upfront cash. Accept earnout only to bridge a small gap. Don't let it be >20% of consideration.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A management team wants to stay involved in the company post-exit through a management continuation plan. How would you structure this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNew Option Pool. Employment Contracts (Golden Handcuffs). Rollover equity into the new structure (Buyer wants this). Retention Bonuses.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nManagement might be 'Cashed Out' (rich) and lose motivation. You need to 'Re-up' their hunger. The new package must offer significant upside (2.0) relative to their current wealth.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Reward for Past' and 'Incentive for Future'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'HR/Incentive' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBuyer will require the Seller (PE fund) to pay for the 'Change of Control' bonuses, but Buyer will fund the *new* option pool. Negotiate who pays.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStructured Rollover (20-30% of proceeds) + New Options. Ensure they have skin in the game with the *new* owner.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"carry\" in PE. How does the distribution of carry affect fund returns and GP incentives?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCarry (Carried Interest) is the 20% profit share. It incentivizes the GP to generate alpha. European Waterfall (Whole Fund) vs American Waterfall (Deal-by-Deal).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDeal-by-Deal incentivizes risk (heads I win, tails you lose). Whole Fund protects LPs (losses net against gains). GP internal distribution matters: If junior staff get no carry, they leave. Alignment is fractal.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'GP Income' and 'LP Net Return'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fund Economics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCarry is treated as Capital Gains (Tax advantage). If taxed as Income, the industry would shrink.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAlignment is key. LPs prefer Whole Fund waterfalls with Clawbacks. GPs prefer Deal-by-Deal.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A secondary PE investor is purchasing a fund's position in a PE-backed company. How would you value this transaction?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNAV (Net Asset Value) +/- Discount/Premium. Secondary buyers usually demand a discount (10-20%) for liquidity. Value based on DCF of remaining cash flows and expected exit timing.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHigh quality assets trade at par or premium (Mosaic). Distress trades at steep discount. The 'Bid-Ask Spread' is driven by the GP's mark vs the Buyer's view of reality.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Reported NAV' (Mark to Model) and 'Market Price' (Secondary).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Secondaries' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSecondaries reduce the 'J-Curve'. You buy a funded asset closer to exit. The IRR is higher (shorter hold), but Multiple is lower.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nValue based on 'Bottom Up' analysis of the portfolio companies, not the top-down NAV. Discount for lack of control.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you compare the returns of a strategic exit (to an operating company) vs. a financial exit (to another PE firm)?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStrategic: Higher Price (Synergies), 100% Cash. No rollover. Clean break. Financial: Lower Price (LBO math constraints). Often requires Rollover. Management stays.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIn 'Frothy' credit markets, Financial buyers can pay more (cheap debt). Or if the asset is a 'Platform', a Financial buyer pays for the buy-and-build potential. But generally, Strategic wins on value.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Synergy Value' and 'Financial Engineering Value'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Exit Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSell to Strategic for max MOIC. Sell to Financial for speed/certainty or if management wants to keep running it independently.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStrategic exit usually yields 20% higher price. Always run a process to find the Strategic.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has achieved significant growth, but the multiple has compressed due to market conditions. How would you still achieve target returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRevenue grew, but EV/EBITDA dropped (12x to 8x). To hit return: 1. Hold longer (wait for cycle turn). 2. Deeper operational improvements (Margin expansion). 3. M&A (Buy lower multiple add-ons to blend down).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf you can't hold (fund life end), you sell. Returns drop. This is 'Multiple Risk'. You hedged it by buying cheap, or you accepted it. Operational value creation is the only hedge against multiple compression.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Market Beta' (Multiples) and 'Alpha' (Operations).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Return Attribution' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLeverage also helps. If you paid down debt, Equity value grows even if EV stays flat.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFocus on EBITDA growth. If you double EBITDA, you can absorb a 20% multiple compression and still win.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"dividend coverage.\" What factors affect the ability to pay dividends?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCoverage = FCF / Dividend. Must be > 1. Factors: Covenants (Restricted Payments basket), Capital Needs (Capex), Volatility of earnings.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPE firms push limits. They use 'Recaps' to pay dividends from Debt, not FCF. This ignores coverage. It creates a fragile structure.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Yield' and 'Reinvestment'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Allocation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIn LBOs, dividends are rare (cash sweeps to debt). Dividends usually signal a 'Mature' or 'Stuck' investment.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nEnsure 'Basket' capacity in the credit agreement. Don't starve the business to pay a dividend unless you are exiting via recap.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze the tax efficiency of different exit structures?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStock Sale (Capital Gains). Asset Sale (Double tax - Corporate + Dividend). Merger (Stock for Stock - Tax deferred). Installment Sale.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nQSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) - Section 1202. 100% tax exclusion for startups held > 5 years. Huge value. Tax efficiency drives the *Net* return to LPs.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Gross Price' and 'Net Proceeds'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Tax Planning' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBuyers want Asset Sale (Tax Shield). Sellers want Stock Sale. The compromise is the purchase price. Adjust the price to equalize the tax hit.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStructure matters. A lower price Stock Sale might beat a higher price Asset Sale. Optimize for After-Tax MOIC.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE fund has invested in 15 companies with varying returns. How would you manage the portfolio to optimize overall fund returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTriaging: 1. Winners (Double down, extend hold). 2. Tweeners (Fix or Sell). 3. Losers (Cut bait, minimize time/capital). Allocate board time to the Winners (highest ROI).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHuman nature focuses on fixing Losers. This is wrong. You can't fix a zero. Spend time on the 5x potential to make it a 10x. 'Water the flowers, cut the weeds'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Problem Solving' (Fixing broken things) and 'Value Maximization' (Scaling good things).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe fund return is driven by the top 3 deals. The other 12 are noise. Manage the portfolio to protect the Top 3.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBe ruthless with losers. Sell them for salvage value. Pour resources into the winners. Power Law applies to PE too.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"dry powder.\" How much reserve should a PE fund maintain for follow-on investments?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDry Powder = Uncalled Capital. Reserve for: Add-on acquisitions (Buy & Build), Defensive liquidity (Covenant cure), Fund expenses. Usually 10-20% of fund size.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nToo much reserve = Cash Drag (Lower IRR). Too little = Dilution/Death in a crisis. In a Buy & Build strategy, you need 30-40% reserves.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Efficiency' (Deployed capital) and 'Optionality' (Reserves).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fund Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLPs hate unused fees. If investment period ends, reserves are trapped (can only be used for existing). Optimize the recycling provision.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPlan reserves deal-by-deal. If a platform needs M&A, reserve for it. Don't keep a generic buffer; keep a specific one.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE fund's largest investment is underperforming. Should you invest more capital (support) or write down the position?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSunk Cost Fallacy risk. Analyze purely on *forward* return. Is the incremental capital going to generate 20% IRR? If yes, invest. If it just plugs a hole, don't.\n</reason>\n<exception>\n'Too Big to Fail'. If the largest investment goes to zero, the Fund is dead (Reputational ruin). You might invest 'Defensive Capital' just to save face and return 1x. Agency problem (GP vs LP).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Fiduciary Rationality' and 'Career Risk'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Decision Making' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUsually, throwing good money after bad is a mistake. Better to restructure (wipe out equity, recapitalize) than to subsidize a broken cap table.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSet a strict bar. Only invest if the 'Rescue' creates equity value > investment. Often, the answer is 'No'.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you allocate capital across multiple investments to optimize the portfolio's return profile?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDiversification (15 deals, 5-10% each). Avoid concentration > 15%. Balance sectors (Tech vs Industrial). Balance vintage years (Time diversification).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nConcentration builds wealth; Diversification preserves it. Top GPs often have high concentration (5 deals). If you have high conviction, sizing up drives Alpha.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Modern Portfolio Theory' and 'Conviction Investing'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Construction' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDon't size based on entry. Size based on 'Risk'. High risk = Small check. Low risk = Big check. Risk Parity logic.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStandard PE is 10-15 deals. Don't go below 10 (binary risk). Don't go above 20 (index returns). Size equal weight initially, let winners run.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE fund has a target IRR of 25% and a target MOIC of 3x. Are these consistent, and over what time period?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRule of 72. 25% IRR doubles money in ~3 years (1.15^3 = 1.95). 3x takes ~5 years (1.25^5 = 3.05). So yes, consistent for a 5-year hold.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf hold is 3 years, 3x MOIC implies 44% IRR. If hold is 7 years, 25% IRR implies 4.7x MOIC. The targets imply a specific duration (5 years). Short holds boost IRR/hurt MOIC. Long holds boost MOIC/hurt IRR.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Speed' and 'Magnitude'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Return Math' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLPs pay bills with MOIC (Cash), not IRR (Percentage). Prioritize MOIC (2.5x floor) over IRR engineering.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nConsistent for 5 years. If exit is fast, focus on MOIC. If exit is slow, focus on IRR maintenance.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"fund aging.\" How does the progression from early investments to mature investments affect cash flows?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nJ-Curve. Years 1-4: Investment Period (Capital Calls, Negative Cash Flow). Years 5-10: Harvesting Period (Distributions, Positive Cash Flow). Aging shifts the focus from Buying to Selling.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFund Extensions (Year 11-12). Zombie Funds. If exits don't happen, the fund ages badly. LPs get annoyed. Secondary sales are used to clean up tail-end funds.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Investment Horizon' and 'Liquidity Horizon'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fund Lifecycle' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nValue creation strategy shifts. Early: Growth/Capex. Late: Cash harvesting/Cost cutting to prep for sale.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nManage the lifecycle. Don't do a 5-year Capex plan in Year 8 of the fund. Match the strategy to the clock.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE fund is considering a major add-on acquisition for its largest platform company. How would you evaluate the impact on fund returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIt increases concentration. If the platform is 10% of fund, and add-on is another 5%, now 15% is in one basket. Risk rises. Return impact: If accretive, it boosts the whole platform's exit multiple.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCross-Fund investing? If Fund III buys the add-on for Fund II's platform? Conflict of interest. Usually, the *same* fund must support it. If Fund is out of dry powder, you need Co-Investment (LPs).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Doubling Down' and 'Diversification'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Construction' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf it fixes a flaw in the platform (e.g., adds a missing tech), it is defensive. If it is just scale, it is offensive.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo it if it improves the 'Quality' of the revenue (Multiple expansion). Don't do it just to deploy capital. Watch the concentration limit.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you benchmark a PE fund's performance against peer funds and public markets?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPeer: Preqin/Cambridge Associates quartiles (Vintage year benchmark). Public: PME (Public Market Equivalent). What would the cash flows have earned in the S&P 500?\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPME is the gold standard. Beating peers is easy (average PE is bad). Beating the S&P 500 + Illiquidity Premium (300bps) is hard. Many funds fail this.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Relative Return' and 'Opportunity Cost'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Performance Benchmarking' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDirect Alpha method. Kaplan-Schoar PME. If PME < 1.0, the PE fund destroyed value vs the Index.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse PME (Direct Alpha). Demand 300-500bps spread over Publics to justify the lock-up.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE fund is between funds (moving from Fund III to Fund IV). How would you manage the transition?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFundraising mode. Track record of Fund III is critical. If Fund III is unripe (unrealized), you rely on TVPI. LPs want to see DPI (Cash). You might sell a winner early to show a win.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nConflict: 'Warehousing' deals. Finding a deal now but closing it in Fund IV. Allocation of deal flow between funds during the overlap. Key Man risk (partners leaving).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Harvesting' (Fund III) and 'Marketing' (Fund IV).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Firm Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLPs often demand 'Stapled Secondary'. Buy my Fund III stake if you want me to invest in Fund IV. Liquidity solution.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nGenerate DPI. Cash proves the thesis. Don't warehouse deals unfairly. Maintain team stability.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"step-downs\" in PE fees. How do they affect GP-LP alignment?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAfter the Investment Period (Year 5), management fees 'Step Down' from % of Committed Capital to % of Invested Capital (or Net Invested). Fees drop as assets are sold.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nThis aligns incentives. GP shouldn't get paid for dry powder they can't use, or for assets they sold. It encourages exits. Without step-downs, GPs milk the fees (Zombie funds).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Fixed Costs' (Rent/Salaries) and 'Declining Revenue' (Fees).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fee Structure' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSome funds step down the *Rate* (2% to 1.5%) instead of the *Base*. Both reduce the drag.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStep-downs are standard Lpa terms. Ensure they kick in promptly. It forces the GP to raise the next fund (perform) to maintain income.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE fund has written off 30% of its portfolio (invested capital). How does this affect projected fund returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLoss Ratio 30%. To get a 2x fund return, the remaining 70% must generate ~2.9x ($100 fund -> $30 loss, $70 active -> need $200 total -> $70 * 2.85 = $200).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIt puts pressure on the winners. The 'Drag' of the zeroes is heavy. However, PE loss rates are usually lower (<10%). 30% is a disaster (Venture-like risk with PE upside caps). The fund will likely fail.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Loss Rate' and 'slugging Percentage'. PE relies on consistency, not outliers.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Risk Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCheck the 'Recovery Rate'. Is it a write-down to 0 or 50? If 50, there is hope. If 0, it's done.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\n30% loss ratio kills a Buyout fund (capped upside). It might be survivable for a Growth fund. Focus on risk management.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you manage portfolio company board meetings to drive performance?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFocus on KPIs and Strategy, not updates. Send deck 48h in advance (Read-ahead). Meeting is for 'Decision Making' and 'Problem Solving'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDon't micromanage. The CEO runs the company. The Board governs. Conflict: PE associates asking for endless data vs CEO needing to work. 'Governance Tax'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Oversight' and 'Interference'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Governance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe best boards have 'Executive Sessions' (without CEO) to discuss talent, and 'Strategy Sessions' (with CEO) to build the future.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStandardize the Board Deck. Focus on Leading Indicators (Pipeline, NPS), not just Lagging (EBITDA). Be a thought partner.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "A portfolio company requires a significant additional investment due to market disruption. Should the fund invest or let it fail?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDefensive Follow-on. Analyze 'Return on New Capital'. If the new money yields 20%+, invest. Treat the old money as sunk.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCross-collateralization risk. LPs hate throwing good money after bad. If the business model is broken (disrupted), let it fail. If it's a liquidity crunch (COVID), bridge it.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Sunk Cost' and 'Option Value'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Crisis Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIs there a 'White Knight'? Can you sell it cheap? Bankruptcy protection? Rescue financing (Debtor-in-Possession)? Explore alternatives before writing the check.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInvest only if there is a clear path to recovery. Otherwise, protect the rest of the fund.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"clawback.\" When would a GP owe clawback to LPs?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nClawback ensures GPs don't take more than 20% of profits *over the life of the fund*. If early deals win (GP takes carry) and later deals lose (Fund profit drops), the GP was overpaid. They must pay back the excess carry.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIt is a 'Net of Tax' payback usually. GPs hate writing checks. To avoid this, use a 'Escrow' (hold back 30% of carry) or 'Test 2' (Portfolio value test).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Realized Carry' and 'Accrued Liability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fund Terms' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nClawback risk is high in 'Deal-by-Deal' waterfalls. It is low in 'Whole Fund' waterfalls (Back-ended carry).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLPs demand clawback mechanisms backed by GP personal guarantees. It enforces the 'Whole Fund' alignment.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "How would you decide between increasing your stake in a winner (follow-on) vs. deploying capital to new investments?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nWinners have momentum, proven team, known risks. New deals are unknown. Risk-adjusted return is often higher in the winner ('Averaging Up').\n</reason>\n<exception>\nConcentration risk. Valuation discipline (Winners get expensive). If the winner is at 20x revenue, maybe the marginal return is lower than a new cheap deal. 'Rebalancing'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Conviction' and 'Diversification/Valuation'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Allocation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLook at the 'Unit Economics'. If they are improving, double down. If degrading, stop. The 'Best investment is usually in your own portfolio'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFollow the winners. The error of omission (selling early/diluting) costs more than the error of commission (concentration) in Power Law portfolios.\n</conclusion>"
