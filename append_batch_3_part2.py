        "Question": "Is 'Inequality' inevitable?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. The Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) is universal. Talent, luck, and work ethic are not evenly distributed. Price's Law states that the square root of people do 50% of the work. Hierarchy is natural (lobsters).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Extreme inequality is a policy choice. Hunter-gatherers were egalitarian. The Nordic countries have low inequality due to taxes and unions. We can compress the distribution through political will.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Natural Variance' (Biology/Math) and 'Social Engineering' (Policy).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Economics' and 'Sociology' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSome inequality is natural (competence), but *compounding* inequality (dynastic wealth) is artificial. The 'Gini Coefficient' is a dial we can turn, not a constant of nature.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInequality of *outcome* is inevitable; inequality of *opportunity* is not. We should aim for a floor (safety net) and a ceiling (anti-monopoly), allowing the middle to vary by merit.\n</deconstruction>"

    {
        "Question": "Does 'History Repeat Itself'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it'. Human nature is constant (greed, fear). Empires rise and fall in cycles (Turchin). We are seeing the 1930s again today.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. 'History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes'. Technology changes the variables. Nuclear weapons, the internet, and AI create situations that have no precedent. The context is always unique (Heraclitus's river).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cyclical History' and 'Linear/Progressive History'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Philosophy of History' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPatterns repeat (inflation, war), but the *scale* changes. We can learn the patterns to break the cycle. Historical determinism is lazy thinking.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse history as a 'Case Study' library, not a crystal ball. The rhyming is real because human psychology is static, but the outcome is open because technology is dynamic.\n</deconstruction>"

    {
        "Question": "Is the 'Constitution' anti-democratic?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. The Senate (2 senators per state) gives Wyoming the same power as California. The Electoral College overrides the popular vote. It was designed by aristocrats to curb the 'mob'. It is a minority rule document.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It was designed to prevent the 'Tyranny of the Majority'. Democracy is not just 50% + 1. It protects the rights of the minority (small states). It is a 'Republic', not a direct democracy. Friction is a feature, not a bug.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'One Person One Vote' and 'Federalism/Checks and Balances'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Theory' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe founders feared 'Demagoguery'. They built speed bumps. However, the demographic shift has made the speed bumps into walls (permanent minority rule). The balance is off.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is 'Counter-Majoritarian'. Whether that is 'Anti-Democratic' depends on if you define democracy as 'Will of the People' or 'Protection of Rights'. It is currently straining legitimacy.\n</deconstruction>"

    {
        "Question": "Should we have 'Term Limits' for Congress?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Career politicians become corrupt and detached. Incumbency advantage (95% re-election) creates a ruling class. We need fresh blood and citizen legislators.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It removes experience. Being a legislator is a skill. If you fire everyone after 6 years, the only people with institutional memory are the Lobbyists. The Lobbyists would run the show. Elections *are* term limits.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Anti-Corruption' and 'Institutional Competence'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Reform' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe problem is not the *time*, it is the *money*. Term limits without campaign finance reform just speeds up the revolving door to lobbying firms. They will cash out faster.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't implement term limits; implement 'Age Limits' or 'Campaign Finance Reform'. Experience is good; senility and corruption are bad.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Universal Basic Income' (UBI) a good idea?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. AI will take the jobs. We need to decouple work from survival. It eliminates poverty, reduces bureaucracy (welfare trap), and empowers people to be creative. It is the dividend of progress.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It causes inflation (too much money chasing goods). It destroys the meaning of work. People will rot in idleness (Wall-E scenario). It is too expensive (trillions/year). The math doesn't work.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Social Security' and 'Economic Incentive/Fiscal Reality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Economic Policy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe pilot studies show people don't stop working; they use the money to study or start businesses. But the inflation risk is real if not funded by taxes (redistribution) rather than printing.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUBI is inevitable if AI works. We must start with a 'Negative Income Tax' (Friedman) to test it. It is the only answer to 'Technological Unemployment'.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Cancel Culture' a threat to freedom?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It creates a climate of fear. People self-censor. Mobs destroy careers without due process. It is 'Mob Justice'. It narrows the Overton Window and kills intellectual diversity.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It is 'Accountability Culture'. Freedom of Speech is not Freedom from Consequences. The public has a right to boycott people they find abhorrent. It is the free market of ideas working. Powerful people are finally facing consequences.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Liberal Tolerance' and 'Social Accountability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Sociology' and 'Free Speech' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe problem is the 'Scope'. Boycotting a celebrity is fine; firing a random employee for a tweet from 10 years ago is disproportionate. The 'Digital Panopticon' makes forgiveness impossible.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nWe need a 'Statute of Limitations' on social sins. Constant purity spirals destroy social cohesion. Accountability is good; vengeance is toxic.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should we colonize space?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. 'All your eggs in one basket'. An asteroid or nuclear war could wipe us out. We need a backup drive for humanity (Mars). It is our destiny to explore.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. We will just export our problems (war, pollution, inequality). We should fix Earth first. The cost is astronomical. Mars is a hellhole; Earth is paradise. Spending trillions to live in a tin can is escapism.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Long-Term Survival' and 'Short-Term Responsibility'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Space Ethics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nGoing to space *helps* Earth (satellite monitoring, solar power, resources). It is not 'Either/Or'. The technology we invent for space (recycling, energy) solves problems here.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nGo. The 'Overview Effect' changes our perspective on Earth. We can do both. Stagnation is death.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Nationalism' evil?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It caused WWI and WWII. It divides humanity into 'Us vs Them'. It breeds racism and xenophobia. We should be 'Citizens of the World'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It is the container for democracy. You cannot have a welfare state without a shared identity (Solidarity). People won't pay taxes for strangers unless they feel a bond. Globalism leaves people rootless.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Universalism' and 'Particularism/Community'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Science' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThere is 'Civic Nationalism' (Values/Law) vs 'Ethnic Nationalism' (Blood/Soil). Civic nationalism is the glue of a diverse society. Ethnic nationalism is the poison.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nNationalism is a tool. Like fire, it warms the house (Solidarity) or burns it down (War). We need 'Inclusive Nationalism' to function.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does 'Truth' exist in politics?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. Politics is about power and narrative. 'Alternative Facts'. It is rhetorical warfare. Truth is whatever the majority believes.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. Policies have real outcomes. If you deny climate change, the sea still rises. If you print too much money, inflation happens. Reality is the final arbiter. You can ignore reality, but you cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Post-Modernism/Sophistry' and 'Objective Reality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Epistemology' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPolitics operates in the realm of 'Social Truths' (Money, Laws), which are constructed. But it collides with 'Physical Truths' (Viruses, Carbon). The clash is when political narrative hits physical wall.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTruth exists, but it is weak in the short term against a good story. In the long term, Truth always wins because it is the feedback signal from the universe.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Privacy' dead?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. We carry tracking devices (phones). We post our lives on Instagram. Governments and Corporations know everything. Get over it. 'If you have nothing to hide...'\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Privacy is about control/consent. We can build 'Privacy Enhancing Technologies' (Encryption, ZK-Proofs). We can regulate the data brokers (GDPR). It is a fight we can win.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Technological Determinism' (Surveillance is inevitable) and 'Legal/Tech Resistance'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Digital Rights' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPrivacy is not binary. It is contextual. I share medical data with my doctor, not my boss. The problem is 'Context Collapse'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAbsolute secrecy is dead. But 'Agency' over data is fightable. We need to own our digital identity. Privacy is power; don't yield it.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Civil Disobedience' justified?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. (MLK/Gandhi). Unjust laws are no laws at all. We have a moral duty to disobey. It highlights the injustice and forces change. It is the highest form of citizenship.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. (Socrates). If everyone picks which laws to obey, we have anarchy. We have a legal process (courts/elections) to change laws. Breaking the law undermines the Rule of Law.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Moral Conscience' and 'Legal Order'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Legal Philosophy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCivil Disobedience accepts the punishment. That is the key. You break the law *and* go to jail to show respect for the system while protesting the specific law. It is a dialogue with the state.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nJustified if the law violates fundamental rights *and* you accept the penalty. It is the safety valve of democracy.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should we have a 'One World Government'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It would end war. It could solve global problems (Climate, AI) efficiently. No more tax havens. A unified humanity (Star Trek).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It would be a global tyranny. There is no escape. If the global government becomes corrupt, where do you go? Competition between nations keeps them honest (Tiebout Model). We need diversity of systems.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Global Coordination' and 'Local Liberty/Exit Rights'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Theory' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nWe need 'Global Governance' (Protocols/Treaties), not 'Global Government' (Sovereign). Federalism on a planetary scale. Solve climate globally; decide school curriculum locally.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBad idea. The risk of 'Single Point of Failure' is too high. Keep the nations, but strengthen the UN/Treaties for the existential stuff.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Religion' a force for good?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It provides community, charity, and meaning. It civilizes instincts. Most hospitals and schools started as religious missions. It answers the 'Why'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It causes wars (Crusades/Jihad). It suppresses science (Galileo). It enforces bigotry (Caste/Homophobia). It is 'mind virus' that demands blind faith over reason.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Social Cohesion/Meaning' and 'Dogmatism/Tribalism'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Sociology of Religion' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nReligion is not one thing. It is a technology of social organization. It amplifies human nature. It makes good people better and bad people worse (Weinberg).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is a mixed bag. As a source of *community*, it is essential. As a source of *political authority*, it is dangerous. Keep it in civil society, out of the state.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is the 'US Dollar' dominance ending?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. The BRICS are rising. The US weaponized the dollar (Sanctions). National debt is $34T. Countries want to de-dollarize to protect their sovereignty. The Petrodollar is dying.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. There is no alternative. The Euro is fragmented. The Yuan is closed (capital controls). Crypto is too volatile. The USD is the 'cleanest dirty shirt'. The network effects are too strong.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Geopolitical Will' and 'Financial Structural Reality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Macroeconomics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIt won't be a collapse; it will be a dilution. A multipolar currency world. But the USD will remain the 'reserve asset' because the US has the deepest bond market and rule of law.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe Dollar will weaken but not vanish. You can't replace the dollar with nothing. Until China opens its capital account, the King Dollar stays.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should we ban 'TikTok'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It is Chinese spyware. It manipulates the algorithm to dumb down the West (Opium War 2.0). It gives the CCP data on every American. It is a National Security threat.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It is a violation of Free Speech (1st Amendment). 150M Americans use it. Banning it gives the government power to ban *any* app. US apps (Facebook) spy on us too. It is protectionism for Silicon Valley.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'National Security' and 'Civil Liberties/Free Trade'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Geopolitics of Tech' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe solution is 'Forced Divestiture'. Make them sell the US operations to a US company/Trust. Fix the ownership, don't ban the code.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't ban the *app*; neutralize the *owner*. We need a comprehensive 'Data Privacy Law' that applies to *all* companies, not just Chinese ones. The problem is the data market, not just the buyer.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Feminism' finished?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Women have equal rights under law. They outnumber men in universities. The wage gap is mostly explained by career choice. The structural barriers are gone. It is now just man-hating.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Cultural sexism remains. Violence against women is high. The 'Motherhood Penalty' in careers is real. Reproductive rights are under attack. True equality is not just legal; it is social/economic.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Legal Equality' (Achieved) and 'Substantive Equality' (Ongoing).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Gender Studies' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nFeminism has waves. The 4th wave is digital/intersectional. The battle has moved from the 'Boardroom' to the 'Bedroom' and the 'Algorithm'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe job is not done, but the strategy must change. It is no longer about 'Rights'; it is about 'Norms' and 'Systems'. Men must be part of the solution, not the enemy.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Gentrification' bad?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It displaces the poor. It erases local culture. Long-time residents are priced out of their own neighborhoods. It is colonization by the rich.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It reduces crime. It brings investment, better schools, and services. It mixes incomes (desegregation). A neighborhood that isn't gentrifying is often decaying. Concentrated poverty is the real enemy.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Community Stability' and 'Economic Development'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Urban Economics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe problem is 'Displacement', not improvement. We want the *investment* without the *eviction*. Build more housing (supply) to absorb the rich so they don't bid up the old stock.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nEncourage development, but protect tenants (Right to Return). Build, build, build. The shortage of housing causes the displacement, not the latte shop.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should we have 'Reproductive Cloning'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. It is playing God. It treats children as products. The psychological burden on the clone (living in a shadow) is unethical. It reduces genetic diversity.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. If a couple is infertile, why deny them a biological child? It is just a delayed twin. We feared IVF (Test Tube Babies) too. It is a reproductive freedom.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Bio-Conservatism' and 'Reproductive Liberty'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Bioethics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe issue is safety (epigenetic errors). If it is safe, the moral objection fades. But the 'Identity' issue remains. A clone is not the original person (Nature vs Nurture).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBan it for now (Safety). Even if safe, the societal weirdness suggests we stick to IVF. We don't need to replicate people; we need to raise them.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Copyright' outdated?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. In the digital age, copying is zero cost. 'Information wants to be free'. Remix culture is creativity. 70 years + life is absurdly long (Disney lobbying). It stifles innovation.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Artists need to get paid. Without copyright, AI and Big Tech will steal all human creativity for free. It is the only leverage the creator has against the platform. It is a property right.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Access/Remix' and 'Incentive/Compensation'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'IP Law' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe system is broken. It works for Corporations, not Artists. We need a new model (Streaming royalties are too low). Maybe 'Patronage' (Patreon) or 'NFTs' (Digital Scarcity) is the future.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nShorten the term (20 years). Expand 'Fair Use'. We need to balance the 'Public Domain' with the 'Creator's Livelihood'. Currently, it is unbalanced toward the IP hoarder.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Population Collapse' a threat?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. (Musk). Inverted demographic pyramid. Not enough workers to support the elderly. Innovation slows down (young people invent). Economic stagnation. It is a slow suicide of the species.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. (Ehrlich). The world is overpopulated. Fewer people means less climate change, more resources per person, and higher wages (labor scarcity). We can use AI/Robots to care for the elderly. Quality over Quantity.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Economic Growth Model' (Ponzi) and 'Ecological Sustainability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Demographics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe transition is painful, but the destination is fine. A stable population of 2 Billion is better than 10 Billion. We just need to survive the 'transition shock' of the aging boomer wave.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is a massive *economic* problem (Pensions), but an *ecological* blessing. We must redesign the pension system, not force women to have babies they don't want.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is the 'Gig Economy' good for workers?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Flexibility. Be your own boss. Work when you want. It lowers the barrier to entry for income. Good for students/parents.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It is exploitation. No benefits, no insurance, no minimum wage. It shifts all the risk (car, gas, injury) to the worker. It is a return to 'Day Labor' serfdom. It undermines the labor movement.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Autonomy/Flexibility' and 'Security/Stability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Labor Economics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe classification (Employee vs Contractor) is outdated. We need a third category: 'Dependent Contractor'. They get portable benefits (health/pension) but keep flexibility.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe Gig Economy is here to stay. We must update the 'Social Safety Net' to be attached to the *person*, not the *job*.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should 'Art' be political?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Art reflects life. All art is political (even silence is a stance). It challenges power, exposes truth, and mobilizes change. Art for art's sake is decoration.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Art should transcend politics. It touches the universal human condition (Love, Death, Beauty). Political art becomes propaganda and ages poorly. It alienates half the audience. Keep the message out of the medium.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Engagement/Activism' and 'Aesthetics/Transcendence'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Aesthetics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nGreat art can be political (Guernica), but bad political art is just a lecture. The politics should be 'sublimated' into the form, not preached.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nArt can be whatever it wants. But 'Didactic' art usually fails as art. 'Subversive' art succeeds. Don't tell me what to think; show me how to see.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "Is 'Globalism' dead?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Supply chains are re-shoring. Tariffs are rising. Wars are breaking out. The world is fragmenting into blocks (US vs China). The era of 'Davos Man' is over.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The internet is global. Science is global. Climate is global. We are more connected than ever digitally. Trade in *goods* might peak, but trade in *services/ideas* is exploding.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Political Fragmentation' and 'Technological Integration'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Geopolitics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIt is 'Reglobalization'. We are trading with friends ('Friend-shoring'). The shape is changing, not disappearing. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\n'Hyper-globalization' (efficiency above all) is dead. 'Strategic Globalization' (resilience + trade) is the new norm. The world is spiky, not flat.\n</deconstruction>"

    {
        "Question": "Does 'Prison' work?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Incapacitation. If they are in a cage, they can't hurt us. It punishes crime (Retribution). It signals to society that rules matter.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Recidivism is high (60%). It is a 'School for Crime'. It destroys families and employability. It treats the symptom (crime), not the root (poverty/trauma). Restorative Justice works better.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Punishment/Safety' and 'Rehabilitation/Correction'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Criminology' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe US model (Retributive) fails. The Scandinavian model (Rehabilitative) works. Prison should be for 'separation', not 'suffering'. Loss of liberty is the punishment; the conditions should be humane.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nWe over-incarcerate. Keep prison for the dangerous few (violent). Use probation/treatment for the many. Current prison is a failure factory.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Is 'Human Nature' good or evil?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nEvil (Hobbes). 'War of all against all'. Without the state, we rape and kill. We are selfish genes. Civilization is a thin veneer.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nGood (Rousseau). 'Noble Savage'. We are born empathetic and cooperative. Society (property/hierarchy) corrupts us. Look at how children help each other.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cynicism/Realism' and 'Romanticism/Idealism'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Anthropology' and 'Philosophy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nWe are 'Pro-Social' but 'Parochial'. We are good to our *In-Group* and bad to the *Out-Group*. We are both bees (cooperative) and chimps (aggressive).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nWe are 'Malleable'.
