    {
        "Question": "A merger arbitrage fund identifies a pending acquisition where the acquirer's stock is trading at $50, the target's stock is at $42, and the deal price is $45. What is the arbitrage spread, and what risks are present?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAssuming all-cash deal: Spread = Deal ($45) - Market ($42) = $3. Return = $3 / $42 = 7.1%. If it closes in 3 months, annualized is ~28%.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisks: Deal break risk (Antitrust, financing, shareholder vote). If the deal breaks, Target falls to 'Undisturbed Price' (e.g., $30). You risk $12 to make $3. Risk/Reward 4:1 against you. Also, Time risk (delays).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Binary Outcome' (Close/Break) and 'Time Value' (Duration).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Event Driven' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf it is a stock-for-stock deal, you must short the acquirer to lock in the spread. If the acquirer is $50 and the ratio is 0.9, Deal Value = $45. Short 0.9 Acquirer, Buy 1 Target.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe gross spread is attractive (7%), suggesting high perceived risk. Diligence the antitrust angle. If clean, put on the trade.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the types of deal risk in merger arbitrage (regulatory, financing, shareholder vote). How would you model the probability of deal completion?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRegulatory: FTC/DOJ antitrust, CFIUS (Foreign investment). Financing: Can the buyer raise the debt? (Check commitment letters). Vote: Will shareholders approve? (Check premium vs history).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nModeling: Implied Probability = (Price - Undisturbed) / (Deal - Undisturbed). Or use historical base rates (90% of strategic deals close). Regulatory risk is binary and political (Khan FTC).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Legal Framework' and 'Political Will'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Risk Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe spread reflects the market's consensus probability. If you have an edge in legal analysis, you can bet against the spread. Financing risk is correlated with credit markets.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDecompose the spread into its components. If the spread is 5%, is 4% regulatory and 1% time? Bet only where you have a view on the specific hurdle.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A hostile takeover is announced with multiple bidders. How does this affect the arb spread, and what opportunities arise?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBidding war! The target trades *above* the current deal price. The spread becomes negative (Target > Offer). Opportunity: Long Target. You are betting on a higher bid.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk: The white knight disappears, and the hostile bidder walks away. The stock crashes. Also, 'Winner's Curse'—the acquirer overpays and their stock tanks, hurting a stock-swap value.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Auction Theory' (Higher price) and 'Deal Failure' (No deal).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Special Situation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBuy Call Options on the target. Limited downside if deal breaks, unlimited upside if bidding war escalates. Or buy Target, Short Acquirer (since Acquirer will likely overpay).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nGo Long Target. The presence of multiple bidders puts a floor under the price (the second highest bid). It is the best scenario for arb.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze the regulatory environment for a cross-border merger? What approval risks would you assess?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nJurisdictions: US (HSR Act), EU (EC), China (SAMR). Any major market can block. Risks: National Security (CFIUS), Competition (Market Share), Strategic Industries (Chips, Defense).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nChina's SAMR often uses merger approval as a geopolitical bargaining chip (Trade War). The timeline is unpredictable. EU focuses on 'portfolio effects' and consumer welfare. US focuses on 'market concentration'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Economic Synergies' and 'Geopolitical Friction'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Regulatory Arbitrage' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAnalyze 'Remedies'. Can they sell overlapping assets (divestiture) to satisfy regulators? If the overlap is the *core* logic of the deal, it is blocked.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAssess geopolitical tempers. If US/China tensions are high, cross-border tech deals are dead. Avoid deals requiring Chinese approval if possible.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A merger is announced but the deal has 18 months to close. How would you compare the arb spread to the risk-free rate and assess whether it's attractive?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCalculate Annualized Return. Spread = 5%. 18 months = 1.5 years. Annualized = 5% / 1.5 = 3.33%. Compare to Risk Free (5%). It is unattractive (Negative Risk Premium).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nUnless the deal has 'Ticking Fees' (Price increases over time) or significant dividends paid to the holder. Or if you leverage the trade. But raw spread < Cash rate is a pass.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Absolute Return' and 'Opportunity Cost' (Duration).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Allocation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLong duration deals have high 'Beta' to the market. If market crashes in 18 months, deal might break (MAC). You are tying up capital for too long for too little.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPass. Arb spreads should offer a premium over cash (e.g., Cash + 300bps). 18 months is an eternity in M&A.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of deal spread compression. When would you expect it to occur, and how would you position your portfolio?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSpread compression means the Target price moves closer to the Deal price (Spread narrows). This happens as milestones are met (Shareholder vote passed, Regulatory approval granted, Financing secured).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPositioning: Buy early (wide spread) and hold. Or 'Trade around the position'—sell when spread is tight, buy back when it widens on noise. Compression follows the 'risk reduction' timeline.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Event Catalysts' and 'Market Volatility'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Trading Dynamics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nMost compression happens at the end (closing). The curve is not linear. It is flat, then jumps.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nEnter after the initial announcement pop settles (the 'Arb spread establishment'). Add size as approvals come in and risk decreases.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A debt-financed acquisition faces potential financing risk. How would you assess the probability of deal break due to financing failure?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCheck the 'Debt Commitment Letters'. Are they fully committed? Are there 'Market Outs' (banks can walk if market tanks)? Check the acquirer's credit rating and the LBO math (Interest Coverage).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIn a credit crunch, even committed financing can fail (banks stall). Or the cost of debt rises so much the deal becomes accretive. If the acquirer is PE, they are ruthless; if Strategic, they might over-equitize to save the deal.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Contractual Obligation' and 'Economic Viability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Credit Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLook at the 'Reverse Termination Fee'. If it is low (3%), the buyer has an option to walk away cheap. If high (10%), they are committed.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAvoid deals with weak commitment letters in volatile credit markets. High yield spreads widening = Financing risk rising.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model shareholder vote risk in a merger? What factors influence shareholder approval probability?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFactors: Premium to undisturbed price (is it fair?), ISS/Glass Lewis recommendation (proxy advisors), Shareholder base (Arbs vs Index vs Activists). Arbs vote Yes. Index votes with ISS. Activists fight for more.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nVote risk is high if the premium is low (<20%) or if the target stock was much higher recently (anchoring). 'Deal Jumping' risk: Shareholders vote No hoping for a better bid.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Board Recommendation' and 'Shareholder Greed'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Governance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nModel the register. If 40% are Arbs, the vote passes (they want the quick exit). If 40% are Founders/Insiders, check their lock-ups.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTrack the Arb participation. As Arbs buy in, the vote becomes safer. Risk is highest early on.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A fund is considering a long position in the acquirer (synergy play) in addition to the arb spread. How would you structure this dual position?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStandard Arb: Long Target, Short Acquirer. Dual Position: Long Target, No Hedge (or Partial Hedge). You keep the Acquirer exposure. You are betting on the deal closing AND the Acquirer rising (deal is accretive).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisky. If deal breaks, Target falls (Loss) and Acquirer might rise (Double whammy? No, usually Acquirer rises on break). Actually, if deal breaks, Acquirer usually goes UP (relief rally). So unhedged Long Target is risky.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Arb P&L' and 'Directional P&L'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Construction' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBetter structure: Long Target, Long Call on Acquirer. Or simply Buy Acquirer after the deal closes (Post-Arb). Don't mix the trades.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nKeep Arb pure (Hedged). If you like the Acquirer, hold it in a separate book. Mixing them muddies the risk management.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of reverse merger arbitrage. When would this trade be attractive?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nReverse Merger: Private company buys Public shell. Arb: Short the Shell? No. Usually, it refers to Shorting the Target and Buying the Acquirer? Or specific SPAC structures.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nActually, in a 'Reverse Morris Trust' or similar, the mechanics differ. Or 'Chinese Reverse Mergers' (frauds). Generally, it involves betting on the spread between the shell value and the post-merger value. Attractive when the market underestimates the private asset.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Shell Value' and 'Operating Value'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Special Situation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSPAC Arb: Buy SPAC below NAV ($10). Redeem if deal is bad. Keep warrants/rights if deal is good. It is a convex trade.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAttractive in SPACs below NAV (Risk-free yield + Option). In traditional reverse mergers, it's a fundamental bet, not a pure arb.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze antitrust concerns in a merger? What precedents would you review?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDefine the 'Relevant Market'. Calculate HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index). If delta HHI > 200 and HHI > 2500, it's presumed anti-competitive. Review past DOJ challenges in the same sector.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDefinitions matter. Is the market 'Search' (Google dominant) or 'Digital Ads' (Google vs FB vs Amazon)? Regulators define markets narrowly to block deals. Companies define them broadly.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Consumer Welfare Standard' (Price) and 'Neo-Brandeisian' (Structure/Power).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Legal/Political' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPrecedents: Microsoft/Activision, T-Mobile/Sprint. Look for 'Vertical' vs 'Horizontal' logic. Vertical deals (supply chain) are harder to block than Horizontal (competitor).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nConsult antitrust counsel. Don't rely on common sense. Regulatory logic is political. Assume delay.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A merger agreement includes material adverse change (MAC) clauses. How would you interpret these, and what triggers them?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMAC allows the buyer to walk away if the target suffers a massive, disproportionate decline (e.g., fraud, factory burns down). Standard exclusions: General economic decline, war, industry conditions (unless target is hit disproportionately).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMACs are rarely enforced in court (Delaware is strict). Buyers use MAC threats to renegotiate price (Price Cut), not to break. The bar is 'Durationally Significant' impact on earnings (years, not quarters).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Buyer Remorse' and 'Binding Contract'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Legal Arbitrage' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCOVID-19 was a test. Courts ruled it was a 'Natural Disaster' (often excluded) or 'General Industry' decline. LVMH/Tiffany renegotiated. Sycamore/VS broke.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nMAC is a renegotiation tool. If a MAC is argued, expect a 10-20% price cut, not a full break, unless the asset is fundamentally broken.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you hedge currency risk in a cross-border M&A arbitrage?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTarget in EUR, Buyer in USD. Deal cash in EUR. You buy Target (EUR). You are Long EUR. Hedge by selling EURUSD Forwards or Futures. Match the notional and the expected closing date.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDeal break risk creates 'Contingent FX Risk'. If deal breaks, you don't receive the EUR cash, but you are short the Forward. You are naked short EUR. If EUR rallies, you lose on the hedge AND the deal.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Deal Hedge' and 'Break Exposure'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'FX Risk Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse 'Deal Contingent Forwards' (Banks offer this). You only pay if the deal closes. Higher spread, but removes the break risk. Or use FX Options (Puts).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse FX Forwards if confidence is high. Use Options/Contingent hedges if regulatory risk is high. Never leave FX unhedged in arb.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A merger is announced at a 30% premium. Is the high premium a sign of strong synergies or deal risk?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nHigh premium implies the buyer sees massive value (Synergies) or was in a bidding war. It suggests high conviction.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIt could be 'Desperation'. The buyer is overpaying to hide their own growth issues. Or the target refused to sell lower. High premiums attract shareholder lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny (Why so profitable?).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Value Creation' and 'Overpayment/Winner's Curse'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCheck the spread. If Premium is 30% but Spread is 10%, the market disbelieves the deal. If Premium 30%, Spread 1%, market loves it.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPremium indicates Buyer's view. Spread indicates Market's view. Trust the Spread.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you structure a portfolio of merger arb trades to optimize risk/reward?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDiversify. Hold 20-30 deals. Limit position size (5%). Mix strategies: Cash deals (Safe), Stock deals (Hedged), Bidding wars (Long Only). Avoid correlated regulatory risks (e.g., don't hold 5 tech deals blocked by the same FTC).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nArb is 'Short Put' profile. Correlations go to 1 in a crash (deals break together due to financing). Diversification helps idiosyncratic break risk but not systemic break risk. You need tail hedges (Index Puts).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Deal Specific Risk' and 'Market Beta'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse leverage carefully. Arb returns (5%) need leverage (2-3x) to meet HF targets (10-15%). This magnifies the tail risk.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDiversify across sectors and deal types. Hedge market beta. Limit leverage to 2x. Accept that in 2008-style liquidity events, you will draw down.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A distressed company is trading at 50% of book value. How would you conduct fundamental due diligence to assess if it's a turnaround or a value trap?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCheck Liquidity: Cash burn vs Cash balance. Debt Maturity wall. Check Solvency: Asset liquidation value vs Liabilities. Is the core business profitable (positive EBITDA)?\n</reason>\n<exception>\nBook value is historic. In distressed, 'Intangibles' (Goodwill) are zero. Inventory/Receivables might be impaired. Real estate might be understated. You need 'Adjusted Net Asset Value'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Accounting Book' and 'Economic Reality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Distressed Investing' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nTurnaround requires a 'Catalyst' (New CEO, Asset Sale, Debt Restructuring). Without a catalyst, cheap stays cheap.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIgnore Book Value. Build a liquidation model. If Liquidation Value > Market Cap, it's a buy (Net-Net). If not, you are betting on ops improvement.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company files for bankruptcy. What is your framework for analyzing the equity's potential recovery value?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFramework: Waterfall Analysis. Enterprise Value (Sold/Reorganized) minus Senior Debt, minus Junior Debt, minus Unsecured. Equity gets the residual. Usually, Equity = Zero.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nOption Value. If the bankruptcy is long (2 years) and vol is high, equity is a deep OTM Call option. If the company discovers a gold mine or markets roar back, equity might recover. 'Gifting': Seniors might gift equity to Juniors to speed up the process.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Absolute Priority Rule' (APR) and 'Negotiation Dynamics'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Bankruptcy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nTrade the debt, not the equity. Debt converts to the new equity. Old equity is usually wiped out. Only buy old equity if you suspect the debt is unimpaired (Solvent bankruptcy).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAssume zero. Only invest if 'Assets > Liabilities' clearly, or if playing a volatility option with 'lotto ticket' sizing.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of emergence equity. How would you calculate expected returns from a Chapter 11 emergence scenario?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nEmergence Equity is the new stock issued upon exiting Chapter 11. It is usually owned by former creditors. Valuation is often low (Post-Bankruptcy stigma, forced selling by bond funds). Returns come from valuation normalization and operational turnaround (clean balance sheet).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCalculation: Estimate Exit EBITDA. Apply peer multiple (discounted). Subtract New Debt. = New Equity Value. Compare to cost basis of the debt purchased. The 'Overhang' of selling pressure can depress price for months.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Fair Value' and 'Technical Selling Pressure'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Post-Reorg Equity' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIt is a classic 'Value' trade. The company has no debt service burden anymore. Earnings explode. The market ignores it.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBuy the Fulcrum Debt pre-emergence, or buy the New Equity post-emergence after the initial sell-off. Target 2-3x returns.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A distressed bond is trading at 40 cents on the dollar. How would you estimate the recovery value and probability of default?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMarket implies: Price = (1-PD)*Par + PD*Recovery. If Price 40, and assume Recovery 40, then PD is effectively 100%. The market prices it as certain default. Recovery estimation: Asset coverage analysis.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDistressed bonds trade on 'Recovery', not yield. Analysis: Liquidation value of collateral vs Priority of claim. If it's Senior Secured, 40 might be cheap. If Unsecured, 40 might be expensive (expecting 0).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Yield to Maturity' (useless here) and 'Recovery Yield'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Distressed Debt' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLook at the 'Blocking Position'. If you own 33% of the bonds, you can block a bad restructuring plan. Control adds value.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIgnore PD (it's 1). Focus entirely on LGD (Loss Given Default). Buy if calculated Recovery > 50.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model the dilution impact on existing shareholders from a debt-to-equity conversion in bankruptcy?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAssume Total Enterprise Value (TEV). Subtract New Debt. The rest is New Equity Value. Determine how much of this goes to Creditors to satisfy their claim. Existing shareholders usually get < 5% (warrants) or 0%.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nExisting shareholders might fight for a 'Tip'. If they threaten to delay the process, Creditors might give them 2% to go away. This is 'Payer's Option'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Legal Entitlement' (Zero) and 'Process Expediency' (Settlement).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Restructuring' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nModel: Old Equity % = Max(0, (TEV - Debt) / TEV). If Debt > TEV, Old Equity = 0. Dilution is effectively 100%.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nExisting shareholders get wiped. The 'dilution' is absolute. The new equity is owned by the old lenders.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company negotiates a debt restructuring agreement. How would you analyze the impact on equity value?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nOut-of-court restructuring (Exchange Offer). Debtors accept a haircut or equity swap. Positive: Avoids bankruptcy costs, extends runway. Negative: Massive dilution.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf the debt reduction is sufficient to make the equity 'In the Money' again, the stock can soar (Option Value). It removes the immediate bankruptcy 0. But if it just kicks the can, the equity bleeds.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Dilution' (Share count up) and 'Survival' (EV preserved).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Special Situation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAnalyze the 'Pro Forma' cap table. Is the new debt load sustainable? If yes, the equity is a 'Leap' option. If no, it's a zombie.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUsually bearish for equity (dilution). But if it prevents Ch 11, it is bullish relative to the alternative (zero).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of a pre-packaged bankruptcy (prepack). How does it differ from a traditional bankruptcy, and what are the implications for equity holders?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPrepack: The company negotiates the plan with creditors *before* filing. They file Ch 11 just to enforce it on holdouts. Fast (30-90 days). Low cost.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTraditional (Free Fall): File first, negotiate later. Slow, expensive, uncertain. Prepacks usually wipe equity quickly, but sometimes leave warrants (Tip). Free falls deplete value through legal fees.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Speed/Certainty' and 'Discovery/Optionality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Restructuring' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nFor equity holders, Prepack is a quick death. Free Fall offers a slim chance of a valuation fight (valuation committees) that might find value.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPrepacks preserve Enterprise Value (good for creditors). They confirm Equity Zero faster (bad for volatility traders).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze management's credibility and capability during a restructuring process?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTrack record. Did they hit guidance? Did they sell assets at good prices? Incentives: Do they own equity or just options? Are they getting a 'Retention Bonus' (KET)?\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIn restructuring, you often need a CRO (Chief Restructuring Officer). The old management is usually part of the problem. If the CEO is still optimistic while cash bleeds, credibility is zero.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Operational Knowledge' (Old Mgmt) and 'Financial Discipline' (Restructuring Advisors).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Management Assessment' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nWatch the 'Cash Flow Forecast'. If they consistently miss the 13-week cash flow, they are incompetent or lying. This is the only metric that matters in distress.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTrust the CRO. Discount the CEO. Look for 'Change of Control' payouts that align them with a sale.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A distressed company has multiple asset classes (debt, equity, preferred). How would you structure positions across the capital structure?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCapital Structure Arbitrage. Long Senior / Short Junior? Or Long Bond / Short Equity. Bet on the valuation break. If EV is 500, Senior is 300, Junior is 400. Senior is money good (Buy). Junior is the fulcrum (Buy for equity). Equity is zero (Short).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nComplexity: 'Structural Subordination' (OpCo vs HoldCo debt). Collateral stripping (J.Crew). The legal document (Indenture) matters more than the math.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Valuation Math' and 'Legal Loopholes'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Structure Arb' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBuy the Fulcrum Security. It has the most convexity. Hedge with Equity puts. Avoid the 'Middle' if you aren't sure where the value breaks.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLong Fulcrum Debt, Short Equity. This captures the reorganization value and hedges the downside.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you monitor covenant violations and liquidity in a distressed situation?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRead the Credit Agreement. Track EBITDA vs Covenant levels (Maintenance Covenants). Forecast 13-week cash flow. Monitor revolver availability.\n</reason>\n<exception>\n'Covenant Lite' loans have no maintenance covenants (only incurrence). The trigger is running out of cash, not missing EBITDA. This delays the default but makes the recovery lower (assets burn down).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Early Warning' (Covenants) and 'Sudden Death' (Liquidity).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Credit Monitoring' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nWatch 'Working Capital'. Distressed firms stretch payables (DPO). This is a hidden debt. When vendors stop shipping, liquidity collapses instantly.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFocus on Liquidity (Cash + Revolver). Covenants are waivable; payroll is not.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of control contests in bankruptcy. How would you bet on the outcome?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDifferent creditor classes fight for ownership. Seniors want a low valuation (to own 100% and squeeze Juniors). Juniors want a high valuation (to get a recovery). It is a valuation dispute.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nBetting: Buy the class that controls the 'Fulcrum'. Or buy the 'Blocking Piece' (33% of a class) to force a settlement. 'Vote Buying'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Valuation Expert A' and 'Valuation Expert B'. The Judge decides.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Game Theory' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe Senior class usually wins because they can 'Credit Bid' their debt to buy the assets. Juniors need to write a cash check to refinance them, which is hard in distress.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBet on the Seniors unless the asset value is clearly huge. 'Possession is nine-tenths of the law'.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A creditor committee is formed to negotiate a restructuring plan. How would you forecast the outcome?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAnalyze the composition. Who is on the UCC (Unsecured Creditors Committee)? Hedge funds (aggressive)? Trade creditors (want business continuity)? Unions?\n</reason>\n<exception>\nForecast based on incentives. Hedge funds want Equity/Exit. Trade creditors want Cash/payment terms. The Plan will be a compromise that gives everyone just enough to vote Yes (Solicitation).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Liquidation Value' and 'Reorg Value'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Negotiation Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'Exclusivity Period' gives the Debtor (Management) power initially. Once that expires, Creditors can file their own plan. The timeline dictates leverage.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe outcome converges on the Fulcrum Security owning the NewCo. Junior classes get warrants (Gifting) to shut up.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "How would you analyze environmental or legal liabilities that could impair recovery value?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSuper-priority. Environmental claims (EPA) often prime secured debt. Legal settlements (Opioids, Asbestos) can be massive. Treat them as 'Super-Senior Debt'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nEstimation is hard (Tail risk). Can you 'Box' the liability in a separate subsidiary? (Texas Two-Step). Can you discharge it in bankruptcy?\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Financial Debt' and 'Social Debt' (Tort/Env).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Liability Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf the liability is uncapped, the equity is uninvestable. Bankruptcy is the only way to cap it (create a Trust). Value the firm assuming the liability is settled at X.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSubtract the estimated liability settlement from EV. If uncertainty is high, avoid the capital structure entirely. Uncertainty discounts value more than risk.\n</conclusion>"

        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLook at past turnarounds. Do they have a plan? (Cost cuts, Divestitures). Are they 'Operators' or 'Financial Engineers'?\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTurnarounds rarely turn. 'The same people who drove the bus into the ditch cannot drive it out'. You usually need a clean sweep of the C-Suite.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Plan' and 'Execution'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Operational Due Diligence' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCheck the incentives. Is the CEO paid on 'EBITDA' (easy to game) or 'Cash Flow'? Assessment: Interview customers/suppliers. They know if things are fixing.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBet on the 'Asset', not the 'Manager'. If the asset is good, a bad manager can be replaced. If the asset is bad, no manager can fix it.\n</conclusion>"

        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBuy the strongest player (Survivor). They will acquire assets cheap and gain market share. Short the weakest players (Targets/Bankrupts).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSometimes buying the *Target* is better if the premium is high. But in distress, targets go to zero. Betting on the survivor is safer.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'M&A Premium' and 'Bankruptcy Risk'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Sector Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLong the Debt of the survivor. Equity might be diluted to fund acquisitions. Debt gets safer as the company grows scale.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLong Quality / Short Junk. The spread widens in distress. Consolidation benefits the leader.\n</conclusion>"
