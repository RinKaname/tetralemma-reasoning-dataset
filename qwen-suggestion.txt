Question: A quantum computer uses qubits that can exist in superposition states. If a 3-qubit quantum system is in the state |ψ⟩ = (1/√2)|000⟩ + (1/√2)|111⟩, what is the probability of measuring the system in the state |000⟩? Additionally, explain how quantum entanglement manifests in this system and how it differs from classical correlations.

Reasoning: <reason>The probability of measuring a quantum state is given by the square of the amplitude of that state's coefficient in the superposition. In this case, the coefficient of |000⟩ is 1/√2, so the probability is |1/√2|² = 1/2.</reason> <exception>A potential misconception might be that the probability is 1/4 since there are two terms in the superposition, but this ignores that probabilities come from the squared magnitudes of amplitudes, not equal division among terms.</exception> <tension>While the mathematical calculation is straightforward, the physical interpretation of quantum superposition challenges our classical intuitions about definite states. The system simultaneously exists in both |000⟩ and |111⟩ states until measured.</tension> <categorization>This question involves quantum mechanics, specifically quantum computation and quantum information theory. It requires understanding of quantum superposition, measurement, and entanglement.</categorization> <deconstruction>The entanglement in this system means that measuring one qubit instantly determines the state of all other qubits. If the first qubit is measured as 0, the entire system collapses to |000⟩; if measured as 1, it collapses to |111⟩. This correlation cannot be explained by any local hidden variable theory, distinguishing it from classical correlations where information about one particle doesn't instantaneously affect others.</deconstruction> <conclusion>The probability of measuring |000⟩ is 1/2. This system demonstrates quantum entanglement where all three qubits are correlated in such a way that the measurement of one instantly determines the state of all others, representing a fundamentally non-classical correlation that is essential for quantum computing algorithms.</conclusion>
