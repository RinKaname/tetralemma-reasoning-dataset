        "Question": "Was the Meiji Restoration a revolution from above or below?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIt was a revolution from above. A small elite of samurai (Satsuma/Choshu) overthrew the Shogunate and imposed modernization on a passive populace. The Emperor was a symbol used by the elite to legitimize their coup. It was top-down engineering.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIt was driven by pressure from below (and outside). The peasant uprisings, the merchant class financing, and the existential threat of Western colonization forced the elite's hand. Without the social unrest and the 'Sonno Joi' movement, the samurai would have maintained the status quo.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Elite Agency' (Great Men) and 'Structural/Social Pressure' (Mass Movements).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Historical Sociology' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe distinction is blurry. The 'elite' (lower samurai) were actually marginalized within the old system. They acted as a revolutionary vanguard *for* the nation but *against* the old stratification. It was a 'conservative revolution'—change everything to keep power.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt was a revolution *from the middle*. The lower samurai leveraged the pressure from below and the threat from outside to seize the top. It was top-down execution of a survival mandate generated by the grassroots reality.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Is the US Constitution a 'Living Document'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. The Framers could not predict the internet, nuclear weapons, or modern civil rights. The text must evolve to remain relevant. Interpreting it rigidly (Originalism) turns it into a suicide pact. It must breathe with the times.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. If the meaning changes with the times, it is not a Constitution; it is just a mirror of current public opinion. The purpose of a written constitution is to anchor law against the whims of the majority. To change it, use the Amendment process, not judicial activism.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Pragmatism/Flexibility' and 'Rule of Law/Stability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Constitutional Law' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe debate is about *who* changes it. 'Living Document' empowers unelected judges. 'Originalism' empowers dead ancestors (or the difficulty of the Amendment process). Both have democratic deficits.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe Constitution is a 'Framework', not a detailed code. It establishes principles (Liberty), not specifics. The application of principles must adapt (Fourth Amendment covers emails), but the principles themselves must remain fixed. It is a 'Living Application of Fixed Principles'.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Was the Fall of Rome inevitable?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. 'Imperial Overstretch'. The borders were too long to defend. The economy relied on conquest/slaves (Ponzi scheme). Once expansion stopped, the economy collapsed, and the barbarians simply walked in. It was a structural certainty.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Rome survived crises before (Hannibal, Third Century). It fell due to specific bad decisions (Valens at Adrianople, the division of East/West). A better leader (like Aurelian) could have stabilized it for another 500 years. Agency matters.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Structural Determinism' (Gibbon) and 'Contingency/Great Man Theory'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Philosophy of History' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe West fell; the East (Byzantium) survived for 1000 more years. The structure was the same. This proves the fall was not inevitable for the *system*, but specific to the *conditions* of the West (less wealth, more indefensible borders).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDecline was structural (economic rot), but the *Fall* (476 AD) was contingent. It could have managed a 'soft landing' or transformation (like the East) if not for a specific cascade of political failures.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Does the 'Right to Privacy' exist in public?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. 'Public' means observable. If you walk on the street, you have no expectation of privacy. Cameras, witnesses, and AI tracking are just recording what is already visible. You cannot hide in plain sight.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. Privacy is not 'secrecy'; it is 'obscurity'. Being seen by one person is different from being tracked by a facial recognition database forever. We have a right to be 'faces in the crowd', not data points in a dragnet.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Spatial definition of Privacy' (Location) and 'Informational definition of Privacy' (Data aggregation).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Legal Theory' and 'Surveillance' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'Mosaic Theory' in law suggests that the *aggregate* of public movements reveals intimate details (religion, health, politics) that single observations do not. The sum is greater than the parts.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nWe need a right to 'Public Anonymity'. You can be seen, but not *identified and logged* en masse without a warrant. Technology changes the nature of 'public' observation from ephemeral to persistent.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Is 'War' part of human nature?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Chimpanzees wage war. Hunter-gatherer tribes had high homicide rates. We are evolved for in-group cooperation and out-group aggression. Conflict is in our DNA (Hobbes).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. War is a cultural invention (Rousseau). The archaeological record shows little evidence of organized war before the Neolithic (farming/property). We are capable of violence, but 'War' (organized state violence) is a software bug, not hardware.\n</reason>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Evolutionary Psychology' (Biological determinism) and 'Anthropology' (Cultural determinism).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Anthropology' and 'Political Theory' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nViolence is natural; War is institutional. War requires logistics, hierarchy, and ideology. It utilizes our aggressive instincts, but it is not inevitable. We can build institutions (Law/Trade) that channel aggression into non-lethal competition.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAggression is nature; War is nurture. We cannot remove the instinct, but we can dismantle the institution. Peace is an active construction, not a passive default.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "Should 'Hate Speech' be protected?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. The First Amendment protects unpopular speech. Popular speech needs no protection. If we ban hate speech, we create a 'Ministry of Truth' that defines 'Hate'. Today it's Nazis; tomorrow it's dissidents. The solution to bad speech is more speech.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Hate speech silences minorities. It causes psychological harm and incites violence (Stochastic Terrorism). A tolerant society cannot tolerate intolerance (Popper's Paradox). It excludes people from the democratic square.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Libertarian Free Speech' (Marketplace of Ideas) and 'Egalitarian Dignity' (Safety/Inclusion).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Constitutional Law' and 'Political Philosophy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe US is an outlier. Most democracies ban hate speech. The internet amplifies speech to the point where 'counter-speech' is drowned out. The 'Marketplace' is broken by algorithms.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nProtect the *content* (viewpoint neutrality) but regulate the *amplification* (conduct). You can say it, but the algorithm shouldn't be forced to megaphone it. Direct incitement to violence remains the hard red line.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Is the 'Thucydides Trap' (US vs China) inevitable?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. In 12 of 16 historical cases where a rising power challenged a ruling power, war resulted. The structural stress (fear, honor, interest) forces conflict. China wants to change the rules; the US wants to keep them. Collision is physics.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. We have nuclear weapons (MAD). The cost of war is infinite. Also, the world is economically intertwined (globalization) unlike Sparta and Athens. We can have 'Cold Peace' or rivalry without kinetic war.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Realist Structuralism' (History repeats) and 'Liberal Interdependence/Deterrence' (Technology changes things).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'International Relations' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe trap is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we treat China as an enemy, they become one. The conflict is not about territory, but about 'Legitimacy' and 'Narrative'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nWar is not inevitable, but high friction is. The outcome depends on statecraft. We need to create a mechanism for 'Peaceful Competition' (like the Olympics) rather than a zero-sum death match.\n</deconstruction>"

    {
        "Question": "Did the 'Great Divergence' (West overtaking East) happen due to Geography?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes (Diamond/Sachs). Europe had fragmented geography (mountains/coastlines) which forced competition and innovation. China was a monolith (flat plains) which allowed for unitary empire and stagnation. Coal deposits in UK kicked off the Industrial Revolution.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo (Acemoglu/Robinson). It was Institutions. Europe developed property rights, patents, and rule of law (Glorious Revolution). China had extractive institutions. Culture and politics drove the divergence, not rocks and weather.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Environmental Determinism' and 'Institutional Economics'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Economic History' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nGeography shapes institutions, which shape growth. Europe's fragmentation prevented a single Emperor from banning ships (like the Ming did). So geography enabled the *political* competition that drove the *economic* success.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nGeography dealt the hand; Institutions played it. The West won because its fragmented geography prevented the 'Single Point of Failure' that doomed the centralized Asian empires.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Is 'International Law' actually law?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. There is no global police force. Powerful nations (US, Russia, China) ignore it when it suits them. It is 'might makes right' dressed up in legalese. It is just diplomacy by other means.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. Most nations obey most laws most of the time (trade, aviation, mail). It creates expectations and transaction costs for breaking norms. Reputation is the enforcement mechanism. It creates order out of anarchy.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Realism' (Power) and 'Liberal Institutionalism' (Norms).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Legal Theory' and 'International Relations' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIt is 'Soft Law'. It works like a credit rating. You can default (break the law), but your cost of doing business goes up. It is enforced by the market and peers, not a sovereign.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is a 'Coordination Game' protocol, not a 'Criminal Code'. It works for low-stakes coordination but fails for high-stakes survival issues. It is law, but weak law.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should we have 'Open Borders'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Freedom of movement is a human right. Arbitrary lines on a map shouldn't determine your destiny. Economically, labor should move to where it is most productive. It would double global GDP.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. A state is defined by its borders. A welfare state cannot survive open borders (Milton Friedman). You cannot have free healthcare and unlimited immigration. It would destroy social cohesion and national identity.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cosmopolitan Humanism/Efficiency' and 'National Sovereignty/Social Contract'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Economy' and 'Ethics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary is false. You can have 'Open Labor Markets' (Guest workers) without 'Open Citizenship'. Or you can have 'Open Borders' with 'Restricted Welfare'. The conflict is between the *Welfare State* and *Migration*, not the Nation and Migration.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nManage migration flow to match assimilation capacity. Full open borders are incompatible with the modern social safety net. We must balance global justice with local stability.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Was the American Revolution a tax revolt?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. 'No Taxation Without Representation'. The Stamp Act and Tea Act sparked the anger. It was an economic protest against British extraction.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The taxes were low (lower than in Britain). It was about *Sovereignty* and *Ideology*. The colonists were reading Locke and Montesquieu. They feared the *precedent* of tyranny, not the cost of tea. It was a constitutional crisis.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Materialist History' (Money) and 'Ideological History' (Ideas).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Historical Causality' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe elite (Washington, Adams) cared about Ideology; the masses cared about Taxes/Land. The revolution succeeded because the elite fused their abstract cause with the popular economic grievance.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt was an Ideological war triggered by Economic sparks. The tax was the symbol of the slavery they feared. 'The power to tax is the power to destroy'.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Judicial Review' (Marbury v. Madison) democratic?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. Unelected judges striking down laws passed by elected representatives is anti-democratic. It is a 'Juristocracy'. The people should decide the meaning of the Constitution through their vote.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. Democracy is not just majority rule; it is 'Rule of Law'. If the majority can violate the Constitution, rights mean nothing. The Court protects the minority and the structure of democracy itself from the mob.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Majoritarian Democracy' and 'Constitutional Republic'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Constitutional Theory' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nWithout Judicial Review, the Constitution is just advice. The Legislature cannot police itself. The Court is the 'Ref', not the 'Player'. But when the Ref changes the rules (Activism), it becomes a Player.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is a necessary 'Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty'. It checks the tyranny of the majority, but it requires judicial restraint to remain legitimate. It is the brake pedal on the democratic car.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Did the USSR lose the Cold War because of Reagan?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Reagan's defense buildup (Star Wars) forced the Soviets to spend money they didn't have. His moral clarity ('Evil Empire') delegitimized them. He pushed them over the edge.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The USSR collapsed from within. The command economy was inefficient (shortages). Gorbachev's reforms (Glasnost/Perestroika) unleashed forces he couldn't control. Nationalism in the republics tore it apart. It was suicide, not murder.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'External Pressure' (containment) and 'Internal Contradictions' (structural rot).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Historical Causality' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nReagan accelerated the timeline, but the destination was set. The USSR was a 'Giant with feet of clay'. Reagan kicked the door, but the building was already rotten.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe collapse was structural, catalyzed by US pressure. Without Reagan, the USSR might have limped on for another decade (like North Korea), but its model was fundamentally broken in the information age.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Is 'Property' a natural right?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes (Locke). You own your body/labor. When you mix labor with nature, you create property. It precedes the state. The state exists to protect it.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo (Rousseau/Marx). Property is a social creation. Nature gave the earth to everyone. 'The first man who enclosed a piece of ground... was the founder of civil society.' Property is theft from the commons.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Natural Law' and 'Social Constructivism'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Philosophy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nProperty is a bundle of rights (use, exclude, transfer). It is a *solution* to the Tragedy of the Commons. It is a useful fiction we agree on to encourage investment and stewardship.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is not a 'Natural Right' like free speech, but it is a necessary 'Civil Right' for a functioning society. It is instrumental, not intrinsic. The state defines its limits (zoning, tax).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Should we pay Reparations for Slavery?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Slavery built the wealth of the West. Unpaid labor was stolen. The racial wealth gap today is the direct result of that theft and subsequent discrimination (Redlining). Justice requires restitution.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The perpetrators and victims are dead. You cannot tax people who never owned slaves to pay people who were never slaves. It creates collective guilt and racial resentment. It is logistically impossible to calculate.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Historical Justice' (Intergenerational) and 'Individual Justice' (Contemporary).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Social Justice' and 'Economics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDirect cash checks might be divisive. The synthesis is 'Targeted Investment' (Baby Bonds, Housing Grants) based on *economic* status that disproportionately helps the descendants of slaves without being explicitly race-based.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAcknowledge the debt, but pay it forward through systemic investment in marginalized communities. Repair the *damage* (wealth gap), don't just punish the *ghosts*.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Terrorism' ever justified?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. Targeting civilians is a war crime. The ends do not justify the means. Violence against innocents delegates any political cause.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter'. If you are oppressed by a military superpower and have no army, asymmetric warfare is the only option. Was the French Resistance terrorism? Was Nelson Mandela?\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Moral Absolutism' (Civilians are off limits) and 'Asymmetric Necessity' (War of the weak).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Military Ethics' and 'Political Theory' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe definition hangs on 'Civilians'. If the target is military/infrastructure, it is guerilla warfare. If the target is a cafe, it is terrorism. The *tactic* defines the crime, not the *cause*.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nArmed resistance against oppression can be legitimate (Just War), but targeting non-combatants is never legitimate. You can fight the state without murdering the public. Terrorism is a tactical choice, usually a counter-productive one.\n</deconstruction>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Does the 'Social Contract' exist?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. By living in a society, using its roads, and accepting its protection, you implicitly consent to its laws and taxes. If you don't like it, you can leave (tacit consent).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. I never signed it. I was born here. Leaving is costly or impossible (passports/visas). It is a fiction used to justify state coercion. A contract requires voluntary agreement, not 'love it or leave it'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Implicit Consent' and 'Explicit Voluntarism'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Philosophy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIt is a 'Hypothetical Contract'. It asks: 'Would a rational person agree to this system compared to the State of Nature?' If the system provides order/justice, we *should* consent.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is a philosophical metaphor, not a legal document. It provides *legitimacy*, not binding *obligation*. The state must continuously earn that consent by providing public goods.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Was the dropping of the Atomic Bomb on Japan necessary?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. An invasion of Japan (Operation Downfall) would have cost 1 million US casualties and millions of Japanese lives. The Japanese were training civilians to fight to the death. The bomb ended the war instantly. It saved lives on net.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Japan was already defeated. They were blockaded and starving. They were seeking surrender terms (keeping the Emperor). The bomb was a warning to the Soviet Union, not a military necessity. It was a war crime.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Utilitarian Calculation' (Lives saved) and 'Deontological Prohibition' (Killing civilians).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Military History' and 'Ethics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe choice was not 'Bomb vs Invasion'. It was 'Bomb vs Russian Invasion'. The US wanted to end the war before Stalin took Japan. The bomb secured the post-war order.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt was militarily unnecessary (Japan was beaten) but geopolitically expedient. It ended the war *on American terms*. A tragedy born of the logic of total war.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Is 'Capital Punishment' (Death Penalty) ethical?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. 'Eye for an Eye'. Justice requires retribution. Some crimes (mass murder) are so heinous that the perpetrator forfeits their right to life. It deters potential murderers.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The state should not have the power to kill its citizens. There is a risk of executing the innocent (irreversible). It is applied racially and economically (poor people get death). It is cruel and unusual. Life in prison protects society equally well.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Retributive Justice' and 'Human Rights/Procedural Justice'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Legal Ethics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe deterrent effect is unproven. The cost of death row (appeals) is higher than life imprisonment. It is a symbolic act of vengeance, not a practical policy of safety.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAbolish it. The risk of error and the moral stain on the state outweigh the satisfaction of vengeance. A modern state should transcend the 'Code of Hammurabi'.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Is 'Democracy' the best form of government?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Churchill: 'The worst form of government, except for all the others'. It provides legitimacy, peaceful transfer of power, and feedback loops (elections). It prevents tyranny.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It suffers from short-termism. Voters are ignorant and irrational (Caplan). Politicians bribe the public with debt. It leads to populism and gridlock. An enlightened technocracy (like Singapore or China) can plan for the long term better.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Legitimacy/Liberty' and 'Efficiency/Competence'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Science' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDemocracy is an 'Error Correction' mechanism. Autocracies are faster, but when they make a mistake (Mao, Putin), there is no correction mechanism. Democracy is slow but safe.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDemocracy is the best *insurance* against catastrophe, even if it is not the most efficient engine for growth. Its value is in the 'feedback loop', not the 'decision speed'.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Should we ban 'Lobbying'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It is legalized bribery. Corporations buy laws. The NRA or Pharma lobby blocks the will of the people. It distorts democracy into a Plutocracy.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Lobbying is the 'Right to Petition the Government' (1st Amendment). Lawmakers are generalists; they need experts (lobbyists) to explain complex industries. Unions, environmental groups, and charities lobby too. You can't ban people from talking to their representatives.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Political Equality' and 'Freedom of Speech/Information'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Reform' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe problem is not the *information* (Lobbying), it is the *money* (Campaign Finance). If you ban lobbying, it goes underground. The solution is public financing of elections so politicians don't need the lobbyists' money.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't ban lobbying; regulate the *transaction*. Transparency and Campaign Finance Reform are the cure, not silence.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "Is 'History' written by the victors?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. The winners control the archives, the schools, and the narrative. They erase their crimes and exaggerate their virtues. The losers are silenced.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The losers often write the history (e.g., The 'Lost Cause' of the Confederacy, the German generals after WWII). Historians are trained to dig for the truth. In the long run, revisionism exposes the victors' crimes (e.g., Colonialism).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Narrative Power' (Propaganda) and 'Historical Scholarship' (Truth-seeking).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Historiography' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nHistory is written by the *literate*. The victors usually have the resources, but culture persists. The 'Subaltern' speaks through archaeology and oral tradition.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe *first draft* is written by the victors. The *final draft* is written by the historians. Truth has a long half-life.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "Does 'Power Corrupt'?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Acton: 'Absolute power corrupts absolutely'. Power rewires the brain (dopamine). It reduces empathy and increases risk-taking. Leaders start to believe they are above the law.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. Power *reveals*. It amplifies who you already are. Corrupt people seek power. A virtuous person with power can do immense good (Marcus Aurelius). The system selects for psychopaths, which makes it look like power corrupts.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Psychological Transformation' and 'Selection Bias'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Psychology' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPower creates 'Accountability Vacuums'. Corruption happens when there are no checks. It is the *impunity* that corrupts, not the power itself.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPower tends to corrupt because it removes constraints. We must design systems (Checks and Balances) that assume the leader is bad, rather than hoping for a philosopher king.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Is the 'Nation-State' obsolete?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. Global problems (Climate, Pandemics, AI) ignore borders. Supply chains are global. The internet is global. The nation-state is too small for big problems and too big for small problems (local identity).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The nation-state is the only entity with the legitimacy to tax and enforce laws. People crave belonging and protection. When crisis hits (COVID), borders snap shut instantly. Nationalism is rising, not falling.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Functional Globalization' and 'Political Tribalism'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Political Science' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nWe are moving to a 'Neo-Medieval' world. Overlapping sovereignties (Cities, Corporations, Nations, EU). The Nation-State is not dead, but it is no longer the *only* player.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe Nation-State remains the primary unit of power, but it must share the stage. It is resilient because it commands the 'Monopoly on Violence'.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. It gave us the 'Rights of Man', secularism, and meritocracy. It broke the feudal chains. The modern world is the child of 1789. The terror was a temporary price for eternal liberty.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It led to the Guillotine, The Terror, and Napoleon's wars (millions dead). It replaced a King with an Emperor. Britain achieved the same reforms gradually (Reform Acts) without the bloodbath. Edmund Burke was right.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Revolutionary Idealism' and 'Conservative Gradualism'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Historical Judgment' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe Revolution failed in France (short term) but succeeded globally (long term). It planted the seeds of democracy everywhere. The *process* was a disaster; the *product* was essential.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt was a necessary tragedy.
