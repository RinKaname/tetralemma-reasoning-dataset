        "Question": "You manage a Multi-Family Office. The matriarch wants to put 20% of the portfolio into 'Impact Investments' that historically yield 2% below market. The younger generation demands it. Do you approve?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nApprove. A Family Office's goal is not just wealth maximization, but 'Family Harmony' and legacy. If the portfolio grows slightly slower but keeps the family united and engaged, it is a success. The 'Utility Function' of the family includes social impact.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nReject. Inflation is the enemy of dynasty trusts. A 2% drag compounded over 30 years destroys 50% of the purchasing power. Your duty is to preserve the *real* value of the corpus for the 4th generation. Philanthropy should be done *with* the profits, not *as* the investment strategy.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Wealth Preservation' (Math) and 'Family Governance' (Values). It pits the Trustee's duty against the Beneficiary's desire.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Family Office Governance' and 'Asset Allocation' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary is false. 'Concessionary Returns' are not necessary for impact. You can allocate to 'ESG Integrated' funds that target market-rate returns. Or, separate the pots: 80% Aggressive Growth, 20% Philanthropic Capital. Don't mix the mandates.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAllocate to Impact *only if* the mandate explicitly separates it from the 'Core Corpus'. Do not accept sub-par returns on the main engine of wealth. Frame it as 'Philanthropy' budget, not 'Investment' allocation, to keep the benchmarks honest.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Real Estate Fund Manager. You own a Class B office building in downtown San Francisco with 40% vacancy. Do you invest $50M to convert it to Residential apartments?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. The Office market is dead due to remote work. Residential demand is infinite. Converting is the highest and best use. It saves the asset from becoming a zero.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The conversion cost ($500/sqft) is higher than buying an existing apartment building. Floor plates in office buildings are too deep (no windows for inner rooms), requiring expensive structural surgery. You will spend $50M to create an asset worth $40M. Better to hand the keys back to the lender.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Adaptive Reuse' (Hope) and 'Structural Obsolescence' (Physics/Economics). Not all assets are salvageable.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Real Estate Development' and 'Distressed Asset' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe conversion only works with 'Subsidies'. If the city offers tax abatements or zoning density bonuses, the math might close. Without public sector intervention, the private math is negative.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not convert unless the 'Basis' (purchase price) is effectively zero and the city provides subsidies. In most cases, demolition or default is the rational economic choice over a complex, negative-margin conversion.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a High Frequency Trader (HFT). You detect 'Toxic Flow' (informed orders) coming from a specific venue. Do you stop quoting liquidity there?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStop quoting. Informed traders only trade when they know the price is about to move against you. You are the 'dumb money' providing liquidity to them. You will face 'Adverse Selection' and lose money on every trade. Protect your P&L.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nKeep quoting (with wider spreads). If you pull out, you lose market share and exchange rebates. Exchanges penalize market makers who vanish during stress. You need the volume to maintain your tier status.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between ' adverse selection risk' (losing on trades) and 'Market Structure Incentives' (Rebates/Status). \n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Market Microstructure' problem involving Game Theory.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe solution is 'Widening the Spread' or 'Skewing'. You don't leave; you price the toxicity. If the toxic flow is buying, you raise your ask price aggressively. You make the informed trader pay for the liquidity.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not leave the venue. Adjust your 'Quote Skew' to reflect the probability of toxicity. If the venue forbids this, then leave. Liquidity provision is not charity; it is risk pricing.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Startup Employee. You have stock options (ISOs) vesting. The company is private and valuation is high. You leave the company. You have 90 days to exercise. It costs $100k (strike price + tax). Do you exercise?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nExercise. You earned this equity over 4 years. It is your lottery ticket. If the company IPOs, it could be worth millions. Walking away means you worked for below-market salary for nothing.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDo not exercise. The stock is illiquid. You are locking up $100k cash in a private asset that might go to zero. Plus, you might owe AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax) on the 'paper gain' even if you can't sell the stock. You could go bankrupt paying taxes on phantom wealth.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'FOMO' (Fear Of Missing Out) and 'Liquidity/Tax Risk'. The upside is theoretical; the cash outflow is real.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Personal Finance' and 'Tax Planning' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'Golden Handcuffs' rule applies. If you can't afford to lose the $100k, don't do it. A middle ground is a 'Secondary Sale' or 'Forward Contract' where a fund fronts you the money to exercise in exchange for a share of the upside (Non-recourse financing).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nOnly exercise if you have 'Non-Recourse Financing' or if you are already wealthy enough to write off the $100k. Never risk personal solvency for illiquid private stock. The 'AMT Trap' is a career-killer.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Corporate Raider. You buy 5% of a lazy conglomerate. You want them to spin off their crown jewel division. The CEO refuses. Do you launch a proxy fight?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLaunch the proxy fight. The value gap is obvious. The conglomerate discount is masking the true value. Shareholders will support you because they want the stock pop. You replace the board and force the spin-off.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nBack down. Proxy fights are expensive ($10M+) and distracting. If you lose, you are stuck with the stock and no influence. The CEO might have the passive index funds (BlackRock/Vanguard) in his pocket. 'You can't fight City Hall'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Activist Alpha' (Unlocking value) and 'Institutional Inertia'. It is a political campaign with shareholders as voters.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Shareholder Activism' and 'Corporate Governance' scenario.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe threat is stronger than the execution. Use the 'Bear Hug' letter. Publicly shame the board. Often, the settlement (getting 2 board seats) is better than a full war. You don't need to run the company; you just need to force a strategic review.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLaunch the campaign publicly but settle privately for board representation. A full proxy war is a negative-EV event unless the mismanagement is criminal. The goal is the *spin-off*, not the *fight*.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "You are a Quant Researcher. You find a trading signal with a Sharpe Ratio of 3.0 (Holy Grail). However, it relies on 'alternative data' (satellite imagery) that is legally grey in terms of privacy. Do you trade it?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTrade it. Information is alpha. If the data is public (photons from space), it is fair game. Everyone else is looking for an edge. If you don't use it, a competitor will. Returns are the only metric.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDo not trade. Regulatory risk is the 'tail risk'. If the SEC or EU decides this data violates privacy (GDPR), the fines will exceed the profits. Furthermore, 'headline risk' could cause your LPs to redeem. A 3.0 Sharpe is not worth a criminal investigation.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Information Asymmetry' (Edge) and 'Regulatory Ambiguity' (Compliance). The law lags behind technology.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Data Ethics' and 'Compliance' dilemma in Quant Finance.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary is false. You can 'Clean' the data. Aggregate it so it is anonymized. Ensure the vendor has 'representations and warranties' indemnifying you. The risk is not the signal; it is the *provenance* of the data.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTrade only after a full 'Data Provenance' audit by legal counsel. If the data source is clearly legal (e.g., counting cars in a parking lot), trade size. If it involves personal tracking, delete it. Alpha is temporary; a ban is permanent.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Bank CEO. A recession is coming. Your loan book is healthy now, but provisions for credit losses (CECL) require you to reserve capital *before* the losses happen. This will kill your earnings and bonus. Do you under-reserve?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nUnder-reserve (be optimistic). Models are subjective. Why panic before the storm hits? Reporting strong earnings keeps the stock price up and confidence high. 'Extend and Pretend'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nReserve aggressively. This is the 'Kitchen Sink' quarter. Take the big hit now, blame the macro environment, and reset the baseline. If you under-reserve and the losses hit later, you will look incompetent or fraudulent. 'Bad news is best released all at once'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Earnings Management' (Short-term stock price) and 'Prudential Risk Management' (Long-term solvency). \n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Accounting Standards' (CECL) and 'Corporate Governance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'Big Bath' theory applies. Investors forgive a recession-linked write-down. They do not forgive a 'drip-feed' of bad news for 8 quarters. Taking the pain now clears the deck for future profitability.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTake the full provision now. 'Kitchen sinking' the quarter resets the bar and builds a reserve buffer (cookie jar) that can be released later to smooth earnings when the recovery starts. Optimism in banking is a fatal flaw.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "You are a Sovereign Wealth Fund. You are offered a stake in a critical infrastructure port in a rival geopolitical nation. The return is guaranteed 10%. Do you invest?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nInvest. Infrastructure is a perfect match for long-term liabilities. 10% guaranteed yield is unheard of. Money has no flag. Engagement through commerce reduces conflict.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPass. Capital is political. In a conflict, your asset will be frozen or nationalized (expropriation risk). You are essentially funding a potential adversary's logistics network. The return is illusory because the 'Political Risk' beta is 1.0.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Financial Return' and 'Geopolitical Risk'. It is the 'Thucydides Trap' applied to asset allocation.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Geopolitics' and 'Foreign Direct Investment' (FDI) dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe deal likely involves a 'CFIUS' (Committee on Foreign Investment) review risk. Even if you want to buy, they might not let you. The deal is a 'Option on Stability'. If the world remains peaceful, you win. If war starts, you lose 100%.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not invest in critical infrastructure of a strategic rival. The 'Tail Risk' of expropriation is too high. Stick to liquid assets (bonds/equities) that can be sold instantly, not illiquid real assets that are hostages to fortune.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Founder. You can take $10M from a 'Vulture VC' known for firing founders, or $5M from a 'Friendly VC'. You need $8M to hit your milestones. What do you do?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTake the $10M. You need the cash to survive. Taking $5M means you will run out of money before the milestone, guaranteeing failure. You can manage the Vulture; you can't manage bankruptcy.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTake the $5M and cut costs. Taking money from the Vulture is signing your own death warrant. They will fire you the moment you miss a target. The 'Friendly' capital comes with patience. It is better to own a smaller, slower company than to be fired from a fast one.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Capital Adequacy' (Survival) and 'Control/Culture'. It asks if you prioritize the Company or your Role.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fundraising Strategy' and 'Founder Control' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe solution is 'Syndicate'. Take the $5M from the Friendly VC and find a strategic angel or debt provider to bridge the gap. Or, take the $10M but negotiate a 'Super-Voting' share class to protect your control.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nNever take money from a bad partner if you can avoid it. Take the $5M, cut burn, and survive. 'Cap tables are like marriages; divorce is expensive.'\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Distressed Debt Investor. You own the bonds of a retailer. The company offers a 'Priming Loan' (new Super-Senior debt) to keep the lights on. If you participate, you keep your priority. If you don't, you get pushed down the stack (primed). Do you participate?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nParticipate. This is 'Pay to Play'. If you don't put in new money, your old position becomes worthless. You must defend your position. It's a defensive spend.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRefuse. This is 'Throwing good money after bad'. The retailer is doomed (Amazon effect). Priming yourself just increases your exposure to a zero. Let the other creditors take the Super-Senior risk; you take your loss and move on.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Sunk Cost' psychology and 'Game Theory' (Prisoner's Dilemma). The creditors are fighting each other, not just the company.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Bankruptcy' and 'Creditor on Creditor Violence' scenario.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe legality of 'Non-Pro Rata Priming' (Uptier Exchange) is often challenged in court (e.g., Serta, J.Crew). If you participate, you are complicit. If you don't, you sue.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf the underlying business has *asset value*, participate to protect your claim. If the business is a melting ice cube, do not participate. Sue the company for 'Breach of Covenant' instead. Litigation is often a better investment than the priming loan.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are an IPO Banker. The client wants to price the IPO at $50 (perfection). The book is covered. You know if you price at $40, the stock will 'pop' 20% on day 1, making investors happy. What do you recommend?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPrice at $40 (The Pop). An IPO is a marketing event. A 'pop' creates buzz and momentum. Institutional investors expect a discount for buying in bulk. If the stock trades down on day 1 (broken deal), the company is stigmatized forever.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPrice at $50. Your duty is to the *Company*, not the new investors. Pricing at $40 leaves money on the table (underpricing). That is cash the company could have used for R&D. A 'pop' is just a wealth transfer from the founder to your hedge fund clients.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Issuer Value' (Max Cash) and 'Market Sentiment' (The Pop). It is the structural conflict of interest in Investment Banking.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Markets' and 'Pricing Strategy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'Pop' is the fee you pay for liquidity. However, a 20% pop is excessive. A 10% pop is the 'Goldilocks' zone—investors are happy, but the issuer didn't get ripped off. A Direct Listing avoids this entirely.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nRecommend $45. Aim for a small pop (10-15%) to ensure aftermarket support. Pricing for perfection ($50) leaves no margin for error; if the market turns the next day, the stock breaks issue price, and the deal is considered a failure.\n</conclusion>"

Focus on product, not litigation.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFight. If you pay once, you mark yourself as a target. More trolls will come. You must set a precedent that you will not be extorted.

Divesting hurts the university's financial health. Neutrality is the only defensible position.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. The reputational risk to the university is a financial risk.

If you don't have the cash, offer your Pro Rata allocation to your network for a fee (Carry). You monetize the *access* without risking your own capital.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf you have deep pockets, follow your winners. If you are capital constrained, sell the Pro Rata rights via an SPV. Don't let the right expire worthless; it is a valuable option.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Biotech CEO. Your drug failed the primary endpoint (p=0.06) but hit the secondary endpoints. Do you spin the data as a success?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. p=0.06 is 'trending toward significance'. The drug works for a sub-population. You owe it to patients and investors to keep the program alive. A negative narrative kills the company.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. p=0.06 is a failure. Science is binary. 'Data dredging' or 'P-hacking' to find a positive spin is intellectual fraud. Admit failure, conserve cash, and pivot to the next asset. Investors respect honesty more than delusion.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Scientific Rigor' (Truth) and 'Corporate Survival' (Narrative). It is the temptation of 'Post-Hoc Analysis'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Biostatistics' and 'Scientific Ethics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe FDA might approve based on the 'Totality of Evidence' if the unmet need is high (e.g., Alzheimer's). It is not a spin; it is a regulatory strategy. Meet with the FDA before issuing the press release.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nReport the data accurately: 'Missed primary, hit secondary'. Do not claim success, claim 'Signal'. Let the market decide. Misleading the market leads to class-action lawsuits.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a GovTech Founder. Selling to the government takes 18 months (long sales cycle). You are running out of cash. Do you pivot to B2B Enterprise (3 month cycle) even though your mission is public sector?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPivot. You can't help the government if you are dead. Sell to B2B to generate cash flow, then subsidize the government arm. Survival is the prerequisite for mission.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nStay the course. GovTech is a 'Winner Take All' moat. Once you are in, you are in for 10 years. B2B is a distraction. If you dilute your focus, you will lose both markets. Raise bridge financing on the *promise* of the government contract.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cash Flow Velocity' (B2B) and 'Contract Durability/Moat' (B2G). It is a 'Mission Drift' danger.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Go-to-Market Strategy' and 'Cash Management' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe pivot to B2B is often irreversible because the product requirements diverge. The solution is 'Dual Use'. Find a use case where the *exact same* product serves both (e.g., Cybersecurity). If you have to build two products, you die.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf the product is 'Dual Use', sell to B2B immediately for cash. If the product is specific to Govt (e.g., permit software), do not pivot. Cut burn and raise a bridge. A half-baked pivot kills startups.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Deep Tech Founder (Fusion Energy). You need $500M. Traditional VCs say it's 'too capex heavy'. Do you accept funding from a Sovereign Wealth Fund of an autocracy?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAccept. Fusion is for humanity. The technology is too important to die because Silicon Valley likes SaaS margins. Money is fuel. Take it from wherever it exists.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nReject. National Security (CFIUS) will block you or you will be blacklisted from US Government contracts. You are effectively selling a strategic weapon to a rival. The short-term cash kills the long-term viability of the company in the West.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Technological Acceleration' (Science) and 'National Security' (Geopolitics). \n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Geopolitics of Technology' and 'Fundraising' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe solution is 'Government Backing'. Use the foreign term sheet as leverage to force the US Department of Energy (DOE) or Defense (DOD) to match the funding. 'FOMO' applies to nations too.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not take the money if it triggers CFIUS. It is a dead end. Lobby for 'Industrial Policy' support instead. Strategic tech cannot ignore strategic borders.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Millennial. You have $50k savings. Do you buy a house (with a huge mortgage at 7%) or invest in the S&P 500 and rent?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBuy the house. It is 'forced savings'. Rent is throwing money away. Real estate offers leverage (5x) and tax benefits (interest deduction). You can refinance if rates drop. You need a place to live.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRent and Invest. At 7% rates, the interest payment is higher than rent. The 'Opportunity Cost' of the down payment is huge. S&P 500 averages 10% liquid returns. A house is an illiquid liability that requires maintenance (1% rule). You are buying a roof, not an asset.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Financial Optimization' (Rent + Invest) and 'Psychological Security/Leverage' (Homeownership). \n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Personal Finance' and 'Real Estate' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe decision depends on 'Time Horizon'. If you stay for 10 years, buy (amortization works). If you move in 3 years, transaction costs (6%) kill you. Also, 'Rent' buys you 'Optionality' (career mobility).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf Price-to-Rent ratio is >20, Rent. If <15, Buy. Do not view a primary residence as an 'Investment'; view it as 'Consumption' with a savings component. Math says Rent; Emotion says Buy.\n</deconstruction>"
