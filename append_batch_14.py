    {
        "Question": "A family office business (founder-led, non-public) is being acquired by a PE firm. How would you structure the deal to maintain founder involvement?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFounder Rollover (20-40%). Earnout based on transition milestones. Board Seat. 'Chairman Emeritus' title. Keep their name on the door.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFounders are 'Helicopter Parents'. They can't let go. They undermine the new CEO. You need a clear 'Scheme of Delegation'. Structural separation of duties.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Legacy/Culture' and 'Professionalization'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Succession' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe best structure is 'Significant Minority' deal (PE buys 40%). Founder keeps control, PE adds value. Full buyout usually alienates the founder.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nEquity Rollover is the key economic alignment. Employment Agreement is the key operational alignment. Respect the DNA.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A turnaround situation requires significant operational changes and cost reduction. How would you approach this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRip the band-aid. Cut deep and once. Communicate clearly ('The Burning Platform'). Align incentives with the turnaround plan. Install a CRO.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCulture shock. If you cut too much, you kill the spirit. The best employees leave. You need to 'Cut and Invest' simultaneously to show a future vision.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Survival' (Cash) and 'Morale' (Culture).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Crisis Leadership' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nFocus on 'Cash Conversion'. Stop spending on anything that doesn't generate cash in 90 days.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBe decisive. Ambiguity kills turnarounds. Secure liquidity first, then strategy.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A public company is being taken private in an LBO. What regulatory approvals are required, and what adjustments would you make to the model?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRegulatory: SEC filing (proxy statement). Shareholder vote. HSR (Antitrust). CFIUS (Foreign). Adjustments: Add 'Public Company Costs' (synergy). Add 'Takeover Premium' (30%). Add 'Break Fees'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk of 'Interlopers' (Higher bid). Litigation (Ambulance chasers suing board). The timeline is longer (6-9 months) due to SEC review. Debt commitment fees tick higher.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Public Valuation' and 'Private Control Premium'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Take-Private' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPublic costs (Audit, Board, Listing) are usually $2M-$10M. This is instant EBITDA uplift.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel the premium carefully. If the premium > synergies, the deal destroys value unless leverage does the heavy lifting.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A distressed company is being acquired out of bankruptcy. How would you model the impact on equity value and PE returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSection 363 Asset Sale. You buy assets, leave liabilities. Clean shell. Equity value = Purchase Price. Returns are high because entry is low (valuation discounts).\n</reason>\n<exception>\n'Stalking Horse' bidder risk. You spend money on diligence, then someone outbids you at auction. You need a 'Break-up Fee' to protect your time.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Clean Assets' and 'Process Risk'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Distressed M&A' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nYou reset the cost basis. Depreciation shield. No legacy debt. It's the cleanest way to buy.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel aggressive operational turnaround. The low entry price allows for 5x returns if you fix the operations.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company operates in a highly regulated industry (healthcare, financial services). How would you structure the PE investment?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStructure to avoid 'Change of Control' regulatory triggers if possible. Or budget 6-12 months for approval. Extensive diligence on 'Compliance' (billing fraud, AML).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRegulatory risk is binary. If reimbursement rates change (CMS), the thesis dies. Structuring: Use 'preferred equity' or 'debt' to avoid ownership thresholds that trigger review?\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Economic Ownership' and 'Regulatory Control'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Compliance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBuild a 'Regulatory Moat'. High compliance costs keep competitors out. Consolidation plays work well here.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nHeavy diligence. Ensure the 'Chief Compliance Officer' reports to the Board. One scandal wipes out the equity.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A platform company is being built through add-on acquisitions. How would you model the revenue and cost synergies?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRevenue: Cross-sell. Cost: Duplicate overhead. Model: Cost synergies at 50% of target SG&A. Revenue synergies at 0%. Phase them in over 18 months.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNegative synergies. Integration chaos causes churn. Salespeople get distracted. Model a 'Dip' in performance post-close (Integration J-Curve).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Excel Synergies' and 'Human Friction'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Roll-up Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe real value is 'Multiple Arbitrage'. Buying small at 5x, selling big at 10x. Synergies are secondary.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBe conservative. If the deal relies on Revenue Synergies to break even, kill it.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has significant customer concentration (top 3 customers = 60% of revenue). How would you assess this risk and manage it?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nHigh risk. Binary outcome. If customer leaves, EBITDA collapses. Assess: Contract length, Switching costs, Relationship depth (NPS). Valuation discount required.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nConcentration might be a strength (Strategic Partner). If the customer is growing fast, you ride their coattails. Manage: Diversify (Sales team), Cross-sell deeper to lock them in.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Efficiency' (Few accounts) and 'Fragility' (Concentration).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Commercial Diligence' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIs it a 'Key Account' or a 'Key Dependency'? Dependency kills value. Partnership creates it.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStructure an 'Earnout' tied to the retention of those key customers. Shift the risk to the seller.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE firm is acquiring a company with significant pension obligations. How would this affect the deal valuation?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDefined Benefit plan = Unsecured Debt. Underfunded amount ($100M liability) reduces Equity Value 1:1. Cash flow must service the pension deficit.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPension accounting is volatile (Discount rates). The liability moves with interest rates. Inflation reduces the real burden (if benefits fixed). You might freeze the plan (switch to 401k).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Legacy Labor Cost' and 'Current Cash Flow'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Liability' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe Pension Regulator (PBGC in US) can block deals or demand cash injections. It is a 'Super Creditor'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDeduct the full deficit from EV. Negotiate a plan freeze. Don't take the risk if the deficit > Equity check.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"tuck-in\" acquisitions in PE. How do they differ from larger add-ons?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTuck-in: Small, integrated fully into the platform. No standalone brand. Often tech/talent buys. Add-on: Larger, might keep brand, standalone P&L. Tuck-ins are for 'Capabilities'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTuck-ins are easier to finance (Cash flow of platform). Integration is harder (must merge culture immediately). Add-ons can stay loose.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Integration Speed' and 'Autonomy'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'M&A Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nTuck-ins are the best way to lower the blended multiple because they are usually bought for cheap (4x).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBuild the platform, then Tuck-in aggressively. It is the engine of value creation.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company is in a sunset industry (declining market demand). How would you evaluate the investment thesis?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nValue thesis. Buy cheap (3x EBITDA). Manage for Cash Flow. Stop Capex. Consolidate the market (Last Man Standing). Pay dividends. High IRR, low Multiple.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCatching a falling knife. If decline accelerates (tipping point), leverage kills you. Exit liquidity is zero (who buys a buggy whip maker?). You must exit via Cash Flow (Dividend Recap).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Growth' and 'Yield'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Deep Value' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\n'Melting Ice Cube'. Can you melt it slow enough to get your money out? Operational efficiency is the only lever.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nOnly invest if entry price is distressed levels. Avoid leverage. Manage for distributions.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has key person risk (founder/CEO is critical to success). How would you mitigate this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nKey Man Insurance (Life). Employment Contract (Non-compete). Long-term vesting equity (Golden Handcuffs). Succession planning (Hire a COO).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nContracts don't stop burnout. Insurance pays cash but doesn't fix the business. Real mitigation is 'Institutionalization'. Download the founder's brain into processes/software.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Genius' and 'Process'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Human Capital' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf the Founder leaves, does the revenue churn? (Relationships). If yes, you bought a job, not a business.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPrice the risk. Require a transition period (2 years). Build a deep bench.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A hostile acquisition of a PE-backed company emerges. How would you evaluate the takeover threat and options?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPE owners are rational. If the price is right, they sell. No 'emotional' defense. Evaluate: Price vs 'Hold Value'. Is the offer a premium to our exit model?\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTiming mismatch. PE fund might be early in the hold (Year 1). Selling now creates a low IRR or leaves value on the table. Options: 'Market Check' (Find better bidders). 'Just Say No' (if private).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Liquidity' and 'Maximization'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Exit Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse the hostile bid to launch a formal auction. Turn a threat into a competitive tension.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nEngage. PE firms are financial sellers. Everything is for sale at the right price.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company is being acquired with seller financing (earn-out + seller note). How would you model the risk and returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSeller Note = Debt. Reduces cash check. Increases IRR. Earnout = Contingent equity. Reduces risk. Model: Note reduces WACC. Earnout aligns Seller.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSeller Note usually subordinated. If company fails, Seller gets 0. Earnout creates disputes (manipulation of metrics). Returns are levered, but 'Legal Risk' increases.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Financial Efficiency' and 'Governance Complexity'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Structuring' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nTreat Seller Note as 'Quasi-Equity'. It gives breathing room on covenants.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse it to bridge value gaps. It's a win-win for IRR.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE firm is acquiring a competitor to an existing portfolio company. How would you approach the integration?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBolt-on. Merge back office immediately (Finance/HR). Harmonize sales force. Keep brands separate if customer bases are distinct. One CEO.\n</reason>\n<exception>\n'Merger of Equals' mindset kills speed. Acquirer must dominate. Culture clash. IT integration is the long pole. Don't break the momentum of the target.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Synergy Capture' and 'Business Continuity'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'PMI' (Post Merger Integration) problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIntegration Management Office (IMO). Dedicate a team. Don't distract the sales force.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSpeed is life. Integrate fast or not at all. Cost synergies first, revenue later.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company's supply chain is heavily dependent on one geographic region facing geopolitical risk. How would you assess this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSingle Point of Failure (e.g., Taiwan Semi, Russian Gas). Risk = Probability * Impact. Impact = 100% stop. Mitigation: 'China Plus One'. Diversify sourcing.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDiversification costs money (Margin compression). Redundancy is inefficient. You trade margin for resilience. Assess: Can you pass the cost to customers? (Inflation).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Efficiency' (Just-in-Time) and 'Resilience' (Just-in-Case).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Geopolitical Risk' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf the risk is systemic (e.g., War), hedging is impossible. Scenario planning: How long can you survive inventory outage?\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDiscount the valuation for the 'Risk Premium'. Mandate a diversification plan in the 100-day plan.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE firm is considering an LBO of a high-growth tech company currently valued at $500M. The target has $50M EBITDA, growing at 30% YoY. Design the entire investment thesis: valuation, leverage strategy, operational improvements, and exit strategy.",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nValuation: 30% growth justifies high multiple (15x+). Entry $500M (10x) is cheap. Thesis: Growth Equity profile with LBO discipline. Leverage: 4x (conservative due to volatility). Ops: Sales efficiency (Magic number). Exit: IPO or Strategic (Salesforce).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk: Growth slows to 10%. Multiple compresses to 8x. Leverage kills equity. Thesis flip: From 'Growth' to 'Profitability'. Cut costs to support debt.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'paying for growth' and 'loading debt'. Tech LBOs (Vista/Thoma Bravo) rely on recurring revenue stability.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Integrated Case Study'.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nRule of 40. If Growth + Margin > 40, it commands a premium. The PE value add is 'Operationalizing' the scaling (Systems/Process).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBuy. Fund the growth. Exit via IPO at $2B. It's a 'Category King' play.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A hedge fund runs a long/short equity strategy across 50 positions. A major sector correction occurs, and the fund's hedges are underwater. How would you rebalance the portfolio to manage risk?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nHedges underwater? Means Hedges (Shorts) went UP while Market went DOWN? Rare. Or Hedges (Shorts) went down less than Longs. Rebalance: Cut Gross Exposure. Sell Longs, Cover Shorts. Maintain Net Neutrality.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf Hedges are idiosyncratic (Single stock shorts) and they get squeezed while sector falls, it's a disaster (Alpha negative). Stop out the Shorts. Don't double down. 'Risk Management first, P&L second'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Thesis Conviction' and 'VaR Limits'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Rescue' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nVolatility Targeting. If Vol spikes, size must drop. Mechanistic reduction prevents emotional hold.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDe-gross. Reduce volatility. Survive to fight another day. Liquidity is the priority.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC fund is evaluating two Series B opportunities: Startup A (early-stage, high risk, 10x+ potential) vs. Startup B (mature, lower risk, 3x potential). How would you decide?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nVC math demands Startup A (Power Law). You need 10x to return the fund. 3x is PE returns with VC illiquidity. Pass on B.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPortfolio Construction. If you already have 5 high-risk bets, Startup B anchors the fund (Lower loss ratio). It ensures you return *capital*. It buys time/patience for the unicorns.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Ceiling' (Upside) and 'Floor' (Safety).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Asset Allocation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIs Startup B a 'Platform'? Can it buy Startup A later? Sometimes low risk compounds into dominance.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nChoose A. VC is about risk. If you want safety, buy bonds. Don't dilute the fund's alpha potential with beta.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A distressed debt fund is analyzing a company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy with claims in senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity. How would you model recovery scenarios?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBuild an Enterprise Value waterfall. Scenario 1 (Liquidation): Asset sale. Low value. Scenario 2 (Reorg): Going concern. High value. Assign probabilities.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nLegal costs eat value. 'Burn rate' during Ch 11. Fulcrum security shifts. In Scenario 1, Senior gets 80%, Sub gets 0. In Scenario 2, Senior 100%, Sub 50%, Equity 0.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Asset Value' and 'Process Value' (Time).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Recovery Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe Sub Debt is the 'Option'. It has the most variance. If you believe in the Reorg, buy Sub. If bearish, buy Senior.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBuy the Fulcrum. It's the point of maximum leverage on the valuation outcome.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A systematic hedge fund discovers a profitable trading signal but it's only available to 5% of the market during illiquid hours. What are the practical considerations for implementation?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCapacity constrained. You can't scale it. It's a 'Niche Alpha'. Practicality: Execution cost (Spread) might eat the alpha. Slippage is high in illiquid hours.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIt diversifies the portfolio. Even if small, uncorrelated alpha is valuable. Automate it cheaply. Don't put huge capital. It improves the fund's Sharpe even if it doesn't move the needle on AUM.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Scalability' and 'Quality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Implementation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCan you trade 'Related' liquid markets (Futures) using this signal? Cross-asset signal transfer.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTrade it, but cap the size. Don't market it to LPs (can't scale). Use it as a 'Internal Carry'.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE-backed SaaS company is experiencing CAC inflation. Design an operational improvement plan to restore unit economics.",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\n1. Channel optimization (Kill FB/Google, focus on SEO/Content/Referral). 2. Pricing (Increase LTV to offset CAC). 3. Sales efficiency (SDR/AE ratios). 4. Partnerships (Channel sales).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMaybe the product is the problem (Low conversion). Fix the funnel first. Or focus on 'Net Dollar Retention' (Upsell) to reduce reliance on New Logo CAC.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Marketing Spend' and 'Product Quality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Growth Hacking' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nShift from 'Paid Growth' to 'Product Led Growth' (PLG). Virality has CAC near zero.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDiversify channels. CAC always rises. LTV must rise faster. Focus on NRR.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A macro hedge fund is positioning for a potential recession. Design a portfolio strategy that profits during downturns while minimizing upside opportunity cost.",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLong Volatility (Calls on VIX). Long Treasuries (Duration). Short Cyclicals / Long Defensives. Put Options on S&P 500 (Defined cost).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCost of Carry (Theta). Buying Puts bleeds cash. Long Bonds hurts if Stagflation (Rates up). Solution: 'Risk Reversal' (Sell OTM Puts to fund OTM Calls? No, Sell Calls to fund Puts). Or 'Trend Following' (Managed Futures) - captures the move up or down.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Insurance' (Cost) and 'Participation' (Upside).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Hedging' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBarbell strategy. 80% Cash/Bonds (Safe), 20% High Convexity Bets (Tech Calls + Index Puts). Asymmetric payout.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTrend Following + Long Volatility. It profits from the divergence/chaos without predicting the direction.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE secondary fund is acquiring a fund position in a mature tech company. How would you value the position and forecast returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMature Tech = Stable Cash Flow. Value like a Bond/Utility. DCF. Exit in 2-3 years. Discount NAV by 10% for illiquidity.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTech changes fast. 'Terminal Value' risk. Is it legacy (Oracle) or Cloud? If legacy, it's a melting ice cube. Value based on 'Run-off' cash flows, not perpetuity.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Recurring Revenue' and 'Tech Obsolescence'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSecondaries offer 'J-Curve Mitigation'. You get cash back fast. IRR is high, Multiple is low.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPrice for 15% IRR. Focus on the 'Exit Route'. Who buys this legacy tech? PE consolidators.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "A hedge fund is considering a merger arbitrage position in a deal with 40% spread but significant regulatory risk. How would you model the probability-adjusted returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSpread 40%. Break downside -30%. Implied Probability = 50/50? Expected Return = P(Close)*40% + (1-P)*(-30%). You need P > 43% to break even.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRegulators (FTC) are unpredictable. Binary outcome. Correlation with market (if market crashes, deal breaks). 'Position Sizing' is key. Don't bet 10% of fund.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Kelly Criterion' (Bet big on edge) and 'Tail Risk' (Ruin).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Risk Arb' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse Options to define risk. Buy Deal, Buy Put on Deal. Cap the downside at -10%. Does the spread still cover the Put cost?\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBet small (1%). It's a lottery ticket. Or use options to truncate the left tail.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC-backed startup is raising a Series C but is experiencing declining growth rates. How would you assess valuation and fund allocation?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDeclining growth = Multiple compression. Series C is 'Growth' stage. If growth < 30%, it's PE territory. Valuation should drop significantly (Down round).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIs it efficient growth? If they cut burn and are FCF positive, it's a valid business, just not a VC rocket. Valuation pivots from Revenue Multiple to EBITDA Multiple.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'VC Dream' and 'Business Reality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nStructure as 'Structured Equity' (Senior pref, guaranteed return). Protect the downside while keeping upside optionality.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't price as a Unicorn. Price as a Business. Or pass.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "A PE firm is creating a platform company through an LBO, planning 3 major add-on acquisitions. Model the value creation from both financial leverage and operational synergies.",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLeverage: Debt paydown on the platform. Synergies: Cost cuts across 4 companies. Multiple Arb: Buying add-ons at 5x, Platform valued at 10x. The blended multiple drops.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nExecution risk. Integration of 3 add-ons simultaneously is chaos. Value creation is delayed by integration costs (J-curve). Debt capacity might be strained by acquisition financing.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Financial Model' (Excel) and 'Organizational Bandwidth'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Buy and Build' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe Multiple Arb is the biggest driver. Operational synergies are the cherry. Leverage is the floor.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel conservative synergies. Ensure debt covenants allow the acquisitions (Acquisition Basket). It's a winning strategy if executed.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "A hedge fund runs a volatility arbitrage strategy. The market experiences a major shock, and implied volatility spikes. How would you manage mark-to-market losses and tail risk?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nShort Vol funds blow up. MTM losses trigger margin calls. Manage: De-leverage. Buy back shorts (at a loss) to survive. 'Liquidity Management'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMean Reversion. Vol spikes usually revert fast. If you can *hold* (have capital), selling more vol at the top is the best trade. Closing at the bottom locks in losses. You need 'staying power'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Solvency' and 'Opportunity'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Risk Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nHedge with 'Long VIX Calls' or 'Variance Swaps' beforehand. You can't hedge *during* the crash (too expensive).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSurvivability is key. Don't run max leverage. Keep dry powder for the spike.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "A distressed investor is analyzing a turnaround situation. Model the required EBITDA growth, margin improvement, and leverage reduction needed to achieve a 20% IRR.",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBacksolve. Entry Price -> Target Exit Price (for 20% IRR). Exit Price / Exit Multiple = Required EBITDA. Gap between Current and Required EBITDA must be filled by Ops/Growth.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nLeverage reduction acts as equity accretion. FCF generation reduces the required EBITDA growth. If you buy debt at a discount, the 'Pull to Par' generates the return without operational fix.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Ops Fix' and 'Financial Fix'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'LBO Modeling' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSensitivity analysis. If Margin improves 2%, what happens to IRR? Find the 'break-even' operational improvement.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf required growth is > market growth, pass. Turnarounds usually take twice as long as planned.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "A VC firm is developing a thesis on climate tech startups. Design the due diligence framework, key metrics, and exit scenarios.",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMetrics: 'Green Premium' (Cost vs Fossil alternative). Technology Readiness Level (TRL). Regulatory tailwinds (IRA/Subsidy).
