# Batch 10: Questions 151-180 (VC Valuation & Fund Economics)
new_entries = [
    {
        "Question": "A Series A startup is valued at $20M pre-money with $5M investment. What is the post-money valuation, and what ownership stake does the VC receive?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPost-Money = Pre-Money + Investment = $20M + $5M = $25M. Ownership = Investment / Post-Money = $5M / $25M = 20%.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nOption Pool Shuffle. If the Option Pool (e.g., 10%) is created *pre-money* (standard VC term), the effective pre-money is lower for founders. The VC gets 20% of the *fully diluted* post-money. Founders get diluted by the cash AND the pool.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Headline Valuation' and 'Effective Ownership'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'VC Math' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAlways calculate ownership on a fully-diluted basis. The 'Pre-Money' is a derived number. The real negotiation is 'I want 20% for $5M'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPost-Money is $25M. Stake is 20%. Ensure you clarify if the option pool comes out of the pre-money or post-money (almost always pre).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A Series C startup has annual revenue of $50M and is growing at 80% YoY. Using the Power Law of VC, what would be an appropriate exit valuation in 5 years?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAssume growth decays to 20% by year 5. Revenue ~ $250M. Apply a software multiple (10x). Exit ~ $2.5B. If current valuation is $1B, it's a 2.5x return. Not a Power Law hit.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPower Law requires 10x-100x potential. For a Series C to fit, it must have a path to $10B+ exit (Decacorn). Usually requires market dominance or platform expansion. A 2.5x return is a 'Single', not a 'Home Run'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Growth Modeling' (Linear) and 'Venture Scale' (Exponential).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLate stage VC targets 3x-5x returns. Early stage targets 100x. The 'appropriate' valuation depends on the fund's entry point.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAim for $5B+. If you can't see a path to $5B, it's a PE deal, not a VC deal. 80% growth at $50M is elite; value high.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you estimate the TAM (Total Addressable Market) for an enterprise SaaS startup? What bottoms-up and top-down approaches would you use?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTop-Down: Industry reports (Gartner says market is $50B). Bottom-Up: Price * Quantity. (Number of potential customers * ACV). Bottom-Up is more credible.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTAM is dynamic. Uber's TAM wasn't 'Taxi Market'; it was 'Personal Mobility'. Startups expand the TAM by lowering price or increasing utility. Static TAM underestimates disruption.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Existing Spending' and 'Latent Demand'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Market Sizing' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nFocus on SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market). A $1T TAM is useless if you can't reach it. A niche $1B TAM that you can dominate is better.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse Bottom-Up. Count the seats. Multiply by pricing tier. Then adjust for 'Market Expansion'. Top-Down is for pitch decks; Bottom-Up is for operating plans.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup claims it will reach profitability within 18 months. How would you validate this claim through unit economics analysis?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCheck LTV/CAC. Check Gross Margins. Profitability = (Gross Margin * Customers) - Fixed Costs. If Unit Economics are negative (selling dollars for 80 cents), growth increases losses. They can't reach profitability without fixing the unit.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nScale effects. Maybe margins improve with volume (AWS cost goes down). Or S&M spend drops as brand grows (Virality). But usually, fixed costs grow with revenue (Parkinson's Law).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Contribution Margin' and 'Burn Rate'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Financial Modeling' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nValidate the 'CAC degradation'. CAC usually rises as you exhaust early adopters. If their model assumes constant CAC, they will miss profitability.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel the 'Breakeven Point'. How many customers needed? Is that growth realistic? If they need 500% growth to cover fixed costs, it's a prayer.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"burn rate\" in VC. If a startup has $5M in cash, $1M monthly burn, and is growing revenue at 10% MoM, how long is the runway?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSimple runway = Cash / Net Burn = $5M / $1M = 5 months. They need to raise now.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRevenue growth reduces Net Burn (assuming costs don't grow). Burn = Costs - Revenue. If Revenue grows 10% MoM, the burn shrinks every month. Runway extends to maybe 7-8 months. This is 'converging burn'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Static Burn' and 'Dynamic Burn'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Cash Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCosts usually grow too (hiring to support growth). Net Burn might stay constant or increase. 5 months is the 'fume date'. Raise when you have 6-9 months left.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAssume 5 months (conservative). Growth is uncertain; expenses are certain. Panic mode.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze a startup's competitive moat? What defensibility metrics would you assess?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMoats: Network Effects (Metcalfe's Law), Switching Costs (Data lock-in), Brand, IP, Economies of Scale. Metrics: Churn (low = switching cost), Organic growth (Brand), Margins (Pricing power).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIn software, IP is weak (code is copyable). The only real moats are Network Effects and Switching Costs (System of Record). First mover advantage is a myth; execution speed is the moat.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Feature' (Copyable) and 'Platform' (Defensible).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLook for 'Data Moats'. Does the product get better with more usage (Search/AI)? This is the modern moat.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAssess 'Retention Cohorts'. If cohorts flatline, there is a moat. If they decay to zero, there is no moat. High retention is the proof of switching costs.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup's customer acquisition cost (CAC) is $500, and the customer lifetime value (LTV) is $2000. Is this unit economics attractive?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLTV/CAC = 4x. Benchmark is >3x. Yes, attractive. It means for every $1 spend, you get $4 back.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCheck the 'Payback Period'. If it takes 3 years to get the $2000, you have a cash flow problem. You will die of success (running out of cash funding the CAC). Also, how is LTV calculated? Is Churn realistic?\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'ROI' (Ratio) and 'Velocity' (Payback).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'SaaS Metrics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf LTV is based on 10-year retention assumption, it's fake. Cap LTV at 3-5 years. If Payback > 12 months, it is capital intensive.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\n4x is good *if* Payback < 12 months. If Payback is 24 months, you need massive VC funding to scale.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you evaluate a founding team's background, skills, and ability to execute? What are the red flags?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLook for: 'Founder-Market Fit' (Industry experience). Technical co-founder (don't outsource core tech). History of working together (reduces breakup risk). Grit.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRed Flags: Solo founder (lonely/single point of failure). Part-time founders. Uneven equity split (90/10 indicates dominance/weakness). Obsessed with status (panels/PR) vs product.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Visionary' (Steve Jobs) and 'Operator' (Tim Cook). You need both.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Team Due Diligence' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe best predictor is 'Rate of Learning'. Do they iterate fast? Are they honest about what they don't know? Integrity is binary.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBet on the 'Jockey' (Team), not the 'Horse' (Idea). Ideas pivot; bad teams die. Look for a 'Hacker, Hustler, Hipster' combo.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup's product roadmap is aggressive, but the engineering team is small. How would you assess execution risk?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLook at GitHub velocity. Look at past delivery vs promises. Ask to see the architecture. Is it spaghetti code (Technical Debt) or scalable? Small teams can move fast (WhatsApp had 50 engineers).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk is 'Key Person Risk'. If the lead dev leaves, the roadmap dies. Also, 'Feature Creep'. Aggressive roadmaps usually mean they haven't found Product-Market Fit yet and are throwing features at the wall.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Ambition' and 'Bandwidth'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Operational Risk' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBrooks' Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later. A small elite team is better than a large average one. Assess talent density.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nValidate if the roadmap is 'Core' or 'Nice to have'. If they miss the roadmap, do they die? If yes, high risk.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"product-market fit.\" How would you determine if a startup has achieved it?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPMF means the market pulls the product out of you. Demand > Supply. Metrics: High Retention (Flat cohorts), High NPS (>50), Organic Growth (Word of Mouth). Sean Ellis test: 40% would be 'very disappointed' if it disappeared.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPMF is not binary; it's a spectrum. You can have weak PMF (consulting style) or strong PMF. False positive: Buying growth (High CAC masking low PMF). Early adopters might love it, but mainstream hates it.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Push' (Sales) and 'Pull' (Demand).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Startup Lifecycle' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf you are wondering if you have PMF, you don't. When you have it, you are drowning in demand and everything breaks.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLook for 'Retention'. If the bucket is leaky, no PMF. Fix the bucket before pouring in marketing dollars.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup is in a capital-efficient business but is raising at a high valuation. Is this justified, or is there downside risk?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nJustified if the market is huge (Winner Take All) and speed determines the winner. The capital is a weapon to crush competitors, not just to operate. High valuation reflects the 'Option Value' of dominance.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDownside: 'Valuation Trap'. If they miss perfect execution, they can't grow into the valuation. Next round will be a Down Round (crushing morale/equity). They are priced for perfection.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Momentum Investing' and 'Value Discipline'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Deal Pricing' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCapital efficiency should theoretically command a *premium* (less dilution needed). But raising *too much* destroys the efficiency discipline.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInvest only if you believe in the Power Law outcome. Valuation entry price matters less for 100x exits, but matters hugely for 3x exits. Know which game you are playing.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze the quality of a startup's existing investors and board composition?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSignaling. Top Tier VCs (Sequoia/Benchmark) do rigorous diligence. If they are in, it's a good sign. Board: Independent directors? Founder control? Value-add members?\n</reason>\n<exception>\n'Party Rounds' (everyone put in small checks) = No governance. No one feels responsible. Top Tier VCs have lemons too. Don't outsource your diligence. A board stuffed with friends is a red flag.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Social Proof' and 'First Principles'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Governance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nA bad board can kill a company (ousting founder too early/late). A good board recruits talent. Look for 'Helpful' investors, not just 'Famous' ones.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nGood cap table = Deep pockets for follow-on + Strategic help. Bad cap table = Dead weight.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup has significant technical debt. How would you assess the cost to remediate and its impact on future velocity?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTech debt acts like financial debt (interest payments). It slows down new feature development. Assess by: Code audit, bug rate, engineer turnover (frustration). Ask: 'How much time is spent on maintenance vs new features?'\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSome debt is good (Speed to market). Premature optimization is the root of all evil. If the product works and customers pay, you can refactor later. It becomes a problem only if it prevents scaling.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Speed' (MVP) and 'Stability' (Scale).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Tech Due Diligence' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'Rewrite' trap. Never rewrite from scratch (Netscape). Refactor in place. If they plan a full rewrite, velocity will be zero for 12 months. Run away.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDiscount the valuation by the 'Refactoring Cost'. Ensure the CTO has a plan to pay down the debt incrementally.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model the impact of competition on a startup's growth projections?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCompetition erodes margins (price war) and increases CAC (bidding for keywords). Model: Reduce market share assumption. Increase churn.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCompetition validates the market. Sometimes 'A rising tide lifts all boats'. If the market is Blue Ocean, competitors educate the customer. Focus on 'Differentiation'. If they are a commodity, competition kills. If unique, it's noise.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Zero Sum' and 'Positive Sum' market phases.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Competitive Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe biggest competitor is usually 'Excel' or 'Doing Nothing'. Inertia is stronger than Incumbents.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't model 'killing the incumbent'. Model 'winning a niche'. Assume CAC rises over time. If the model breaks with 2x CAC, it's fragile.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup's revenue is growing, but customer churn is accelerating. What does this signal, and how would you dig deeper?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSignal: The 'Leaky Bucket'. You are filling it with S&M, but the product is failing. Product-Market Fit is weak. Dig deeper: Cohort Analysis. Are new cohorts churning faster? Exit interviews.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMaybe you moved up-market (SMB to Enterprise) or down-market. Churn varies by segment. Maybe you had a bad feature release. Accelerating churn is the leading indicator of death. Growth masks it temporarily.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Top Line Vanity' and 'Retention Sanity'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'SaaS Metrics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nHigh churn kills LTV. If LTV drops < CAC, the business model breaks. You cannot grow out of a churn problem.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStop selling. Fix the product. Churn is the priority. Investing in a high-churn startup is lighting money on fire.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC fund has a 2x gross multiple and a 1.8x net multiple (after fees and carry). What does this tell you about the fund's performance and fee structure?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNet 1.8x is solid (top quartile usually). The spread (0.2x) represents fees. It implies a standard fee structure. The fund returned nearly double the capital to LPs.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIs it Realized or Unrealized (TVPI vs DPI)? If 1.8x is mostly 'Paper Marks' (Unrealized), it might be fake (2021 valuations). Cash on Cash (DPI) is the truth. 1.8x DPI is great. 1.8x TVPI is speculative.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Mark-to-Market' and 'Cash Distribution'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fund Performance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAnalyze the vintage. A 2012 fund with 1.8x is mediocre (S&P did better). A 2020 fund with 1.8x is amazing (defied the crash).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nCheck DPI. Check Benchmarks. Net 1.8x is generally investable, but context (vintage/liquidity) is key.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A $500M VC fund charges 2% management fees and 20% carry. Over a 10-year fund life, what are the cumulative fees and carry?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFees: 2% * $500M * 10 years = $100M. (Usually steps down after investment period, so maybe $80M). Carry: 20% of Profits. If fund triples ($1.5B), Profit = $1B. Carry = $200M. Total Cost = $280M.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFees are paid on *Committed* capital, carry on *Realized* gains. The fee drag is significant (16-20% of corpus). The GP has incentive to raise larger funds for the guaranteed fees, potentially diluting returns (Asset Accumulation strategy).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'GP Income' (Fees) and 'LP Returns' (Net Performance).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fund Economics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLPs prioritize 'Hurdle Rate'. Carry only kicks in after 1x capital returned (plus preferred return usually). This aligns incentives slightly.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nVC fees are high. The fund must generate >2.5x Gross to give LPs a decent Net return. Alpha generation is required to justify the 2/20 structure.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"J-curve\" in VC fund performance. Why do early-vintage funds often underperform before outperforming later?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFees are paid immediately. Losses happen early (startups die fast). Winners take 7-10 years to harvest (IPO). So the internal rate of return (IRR) is negative in years 1-4, then hockey sticks up. This shape is the J-Curve.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSecondary sales and pre-seed markups can smooth the J-curve. But marks are just paper. The liquidity J-curve is deeper than the valuation J-curve.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Accounting Returns' and 'Cash Flows'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Performance Measurement' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDon't judge a VC fund in Year 3. 'Lemons ripen early; plums ripen late'. Negative IRR in year 2 is normal.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLPs need patience. Measuring VC on quarterly basis is category error. The J-curve is structural.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC firm has invested in 20 startups. 10 have failed (valued at $0), 8 return the invested capital (1x multiple), and 2 generate 20x returns. What is the MOIC?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAssume $1M per startup ($20M total). 10 * 0 = 0. 8 * 1 = $8M. 2 * 20 = $40M. Total Return = $48M. Cost = $20M. MOIC = 48/20 = 2.4x.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nThis is a successful fund (Top Quartile). The 2 winners carried the whole fund (Power Law). The 10 failures didn't matter. The 1x returns were dead money (opportunity cost).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Batting Average' (Hit rate 10/20) and 'Slugging Percentage' (Home runs).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Construction' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nVC is about 'Magnitude of Correctness', not 'Frequency'. You can be wrong 90% of the time and still win if the winner is 100x.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\n2.4x is a good vintage. The strategy works. Optimize for finding the 20x, not saving the 0x.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you calculate the IRR of a VC fund given investments over multiple years and exits at different times?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIRR is the discount rate that makes NPV of cash flows zero. Use XIRR function (dates and amounts). Drawdowns are negative flows; Distributions are positive flows. Ending NAV is treated as a final distribution.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate (unrealistic). It overweights early wins. Modified IRR (MIRR) is better but less used. High IRR with low Multiple (quick flip) is less valuable than Lower IRR with high Multiple (wealth creation).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Time Value of Money' (IRR) and 'Cash Multiplier' (MOIC).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Performance Metrics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIRR can be manipulated by delaying capital calls (Subscription Lines of Credit). This boosts IRR artificially without increasing cash to LPs.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse IRR and MOIC together. IRR measures speed; MOIC measures scale. Be wary of 'Credit Line' boosted IRRs.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC fund has written off 40% of its portfolio (deemed total losses). How does this affect fund returns, and what does it signal?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIt drags down TVPI immediately. It signals the fund takes risks (good) or picks bad companies (bad). If the remaining 60% are unicorns, the write-offs are irrelevant cost of doing business.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHigh loss rate (40%) is typical for Seed funds. It is alarming for Growth funds. It cleans the portfolio (tax losses for LPs). It stops the 'Zombie' problem (waste of time).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Loss Aversion' and 'Power Law Dynamics'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBetter to write off fast than to nurse zombies. 'Fail fast'. The return depends entirely on the winners. 40% loss rate is acceptable if the winners are 50x.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't panic on write-offs. Panic if there are no winners. Zeroes are expected; lack of 10x is fatal.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"power law\" in VC returns. Why do a few winners generate outsized returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nReturns are Pareto distributed (80/20). In VC, it's more like 95/5. The best company in a vintage returns more than all others combined. Upside is unbounded (10,000x for Uber); downside is capped (1x).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHumans think normally (Bell Curve). We underestimate the tail. This leads to 'Over-diversification' (spray and pray) or selling winners too early. You must let winners run.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Mean Reversion' (Standard finance) and 'Momentum/Network Effects' (VC finance).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Asset Class Theory' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBecause of Power Law, 'Pricing Discipline' matters less for the winner (paying 2x or 3x doesn't matter for a 100x), but 'Selection' matters everything.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSwing for fences. Construct the portfolio to have exposure to infinite upside. Don't sell the Facebooks to lock in a 2x.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC fund's net IRR is 8%, below the target of 20%. What are the likely causes, and how would you improve performance?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCauses: No outliers (missed the big winners), held losers too long, fees too high, or deployed too slowly (cash drag). Improvement: Better deal flow, higher conviction sizing, faster exits.\n</reason>\n<exception>\n8% might be the vintage average (bad market). Or the fund is young (J-curve). Improvement: 'Concentrate' capital in the winners (Follow-on). Stop watering the weeds.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Market Beta' and 'Alpha Execution'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Performance Improvement' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nMost VCs don't beat the S&P 500 (public alpha is cheaper). The asset class is only attractive for Top Decile funds.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf Fund I is 8%, Fund II will be hard to raise. You need a mark-up event or an exit to prove the thesis. Pivot strategy to high-conviction.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze the quality of a VC fund's historical exits? What metrics would you review?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMetrics: DPI (Cash distributed). Exit valuation vs Entry valuation. Acquirers (Big Tech vs PE vs IPO). IPO performance (did it pop and hold, or crash?).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nPaper marks (TVPI) are vanity; DPI is sanity. A fund with high TVPI but 0 DPI after 8 years is risky (cannot liquidate). Secondary sales are valid exits too.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Realized' and 'Unrealized'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'LP Due Diligence' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDid they sell *too early*? (Selling Nvidia at $1B). Did they hold too long? (Round tripping). Execution of the exit is a skill.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFocus on Cash on Cash (DPI). Track the 'Loss Ratio'. A high loss ratio is fine if the DPI > 3x. Consistency of exits matters.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC fund has a high average multiple but uneven distribution (1 winner, many failures). Is this a successful fund?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. This is the definition of VC success (Power Law). One fund-returner makes the fund. LPs get their 3x. The distribution shape doesn't matter to the bank account.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. It implies 'Luck' vs 'Skill'. If you only hit 1 in 100, maybe you just got lucky. A 'Repeatable' process should have more shots on goal (e.g., 3-4 decent wins). Single-winner funds are risky to back for Fund II.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Outcome' (Cash) and 'Process' (Reproducibility).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fund Analysis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLPs prefer consistent returns (lower variance), but VC *is* variance. The 'Uneven Distribution' is the feature, not the bug.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt is a successful fund financially, but diligence the process. Was the winner a thesis-driven bet or a random lottery ticket?\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"dry powder\" in VC. How does unutilized capital affect fund returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDry powder is uncalled capital reserves. Used for: New investments or Follow-ons (defending ownership). Unutilized capital drags down IRR (fees paid on committed capital, but no return generated).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDry powder is option value. In a downturn, cash is king. You can buy equity cheap (down rounds). Having 0 dry powder in a crash dilutes you massively (Pay-to-Play). Balancing Drag vs Optionality is key.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Deployment Pace' and 'Reserves Management'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Portfolio Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nMost funds reserve 50% for follow-ons. If the portfolio fails, release reserves to new deals. If it flies, double down.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDeploy steadily. Don't hoard dry powder for 5 years (LPs hate it). Don't blow it all in year 1 (Vintage risk).\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "How would you model the impact of follow-on investment reserves on fund returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nModel: Initial check gets X%. Follow-on checks protect that X% from dilution in Series B/C. If you don't follow on, you get diluted. If you do, you increase cost basis ($ avg up).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFollow-on usually has lower multiple than seed check, but higher certainty. It dilutes the *Fund Multiple* but protects the *Ownership $*. It's a trade-off between MOIC and Dollars Returned.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Risk-Reward at Seed' and 'Risk-Reward at Growth'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Allocation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nMathematical optimal strategy: Follow on *only* in the Power Law winners. Let the losers go. 'Pro-rata' is a right, not an obligation.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nReserves lower the ceiling (blended multiple drops) but raise the floor (avoiding washout). Concentrate reserves on the top 20% of the portfolio.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "A GP is raising a new fund and claims a 3x return target with $200M deployment. Is this realistic?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTo return 3x on $200M, they need $600M in exit value. If they own 10% at exit, they need $6B in total enterprise value created. This requires 1 Decacorn or 6 Unicorns. It is hard but possible.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nAs fund size grows, returns degrade. A $50M fund needs $150M exit (easy). A $1B fund needs $3B (hard). $200M is the 'Goldilocks' zone. Realistic if they have access to top deals. Unrealistic if they are a generic me-too fund.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'AUM Growth' (Fees) and 'Return Multiple' (Performance).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fundraising' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCheck the 'Graduation Rate'. What % of their seed deals get to Series A? If low, the 3x is a fantasy.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nRealistic target, but statistically unlikely (Top 5% performance). Diligence their 'Sourcing' edge. Why will they see the $6B company?\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "How would you evaluate a VC fund's sector specialization? Are generalists or specialists better?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSpecialists (e.g., BioTech, Crypto, AI) have deep expertise, network, and brand. They win deals. Generalists see everything but lose on depth. In a complex world, Specialization is an edge.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSpecialists have 'Sector Beta'. If Crypto dies, the fund dies. Generalists can pivot (Survivorship). Also, innovation happens at the *intersection* of sectors (Bio + AI). Specialists might miss the cross-over.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Depth/Edge' and 'Diversification/Flexibility'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nEarly stage (Seed) favors Specialists (Technical Help). Late stage (Growth) favors Generalists (Financial Help). The best firms (a16z) are 'Generalists composed of Specialists'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBack Specialists for Alpha in complex fields. Back Generalists for Beta and Resilience. Don't back a 'Generalist' with no brand.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Explain the concept of anti-dilution in VC. How would you model the impact on cap tables?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAnti-dilution protects investors from 'Down Rounds'. If company sells stock cheaper than previous round, the investor gets more shares to maintain value. Types: 'Full Ratchet' (Price reset to new low - harsh) and 'Weighted Average' (Price adjusted based on amount raised - fair).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nImpact: Common stock (Founders/Employees) gets crushed. The investor ownership % expands, squeezing the common. It can create a 'Death Spiral' or demotivate the team (options underwater).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Investor Protection' and 'Founder Incentive'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Term Sheet' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nFull Ratchet is toxic. Weighted Average is standard. Modeling: Recalculate the 'Conversion Price' of the preferred stock based on the formula. Convert to common shares.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAvoid Full Ratchets. It makes the company uninvestable for the *next* VC. Weighted Average strikes the balance.\n</conclusion>"
