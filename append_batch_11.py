    {
        "Question": "A SaaS startup has MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) of $100K with 5% MoM growth. What is the projected ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) in 12 months?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCurrent ARR = $100K * 12 = $1.2M. Projected: $100K * (1.05)^12 = $179K MRR in month 12. Future ARR Run Rate = $179K * 12 = $2.15M. Total Revenue booked in next 12 months (Sum of MRR) is approx $1.6M.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nLinear extrapolation of 5% MoM is dangerous. Growth usually decays as denominator grows ('Law of Large Numbers'). Or it accelerates due to viral loops. Also, churn is the silent killer. Net MRR Growth = New + Expansion - Churn.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Excel Math' and 'Execution Reality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Forecasting' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nInvestors value based on the *Ending* ARR Run Rate ($2.15M), not the booked revenue. The valuation multiple applies to the forward run rate.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nProject $2.1M ARR. But track the 'Growth Decay'. If 5% drops to 3%, the valuation halves.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the relationship between CAC Payback Period and LTV. If CAC payback is 18 months and LTV is 36 months, is this unit economics acceptable?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPayback = Time to recover CAC. LTV = Total profit. You make money for 18 months (36 - 18). Profit = 18 months of margin. It is profitable (LTV > CAC).\n</reason>\n<exception>\n18 month payback is *slow* for a startup. It consumes massive cash. You are funding customers for 1.5 years before ROI. Ideal payback is < 12 months. LTV calculation might be optimistic (assuming 3 year life). If churn spikes, LTV drops below CAC.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Profitability' (LTV/CAC > 1) and 'Cash Flow Velocity' (Payback).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Unit Economics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSlow payback kills growth because you can't reinvest cash. You need external VC to fund the 'Working Capital Gap'. It forces dilution.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAcceptable for a public company (stable), bad for a Seed/Series A startup (cash poor). Aim for < 12 months.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A SaaS startup has an MRR churn rate of 5% and new customers adding $50K MRR. What is the net revenue growth rate?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNet Growth = New MRR - Churned MRR. If starting MRR is X, Churn = 0.05*X. Growth = $50K - 0.05*X. Rate depends on the base. If Base=$1M, Churn=$50K, Net Growth=0. Stagnation.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nThis ignores 'Expansion Revenue' (Upsell). Net Revenue Retention (NRR) includes upsell. Net Growth = New + Expansion - Churn. If Expansion > Churn (Negative Churn), you grow even with 0 new customers.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Acquisition' (New logos) and 'Retention' (Bucket health).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Growth Metrics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\n5% monthly churn = 46% annual churn. This is catastrophic for Enterprise, acceptable for SMB. You replace half your customer base every year. Hard to grow.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFix the churn. 5% monthly is a 'Leaky Bucket'. Growth math is impossible to sustain at scale with that leak.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you calculate the Magic Number (growth efficiency) for a SaaS company? What threshold indicates efficient growth?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nMagic Number = (Net New ARR Current Q) / (Sales & Marketing Spend Previous Q). Threshold: > 0.75 is efficient. > 1.0 is amazing (spend $1 to get $1 ARR).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIt lags. S&M spend today might generate leads that close in 6 months. Using 'Previous Q' is a heuristic. Also, it ignores Gross Margin. A Magic Number of 1.0 with 20% margin is worse than 0.8 with 90% margin.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Top Line Efficiency' and 'Bottom Line Payback'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'SaaS Efficiency' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf Magic Number < 0.5, stop spending. You are burning cash inefficiently. Fix the product or sales motion.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTarget > 0.75. If > 1.0, pour gasoline on the fire (raise capital). If < 0.5, freeze hiring.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup's Rule of 40 score (growth rate + profit margin) is 35. What does this tell you about the business model?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRule of 40: Growth% + FCF Margin% should be > 40. Score 35 is 'Below Average'. Investors discount it. It suggests the company is growing moderately but burning too much, or profitable but growing too slow.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFor early stage (Series A/B), Rule of 40 is irrelevant. Growth matters more (Triple, Triple, Double). 100% growth with -50% margin (Score 50) is great. 10% growth with 25% margin (Score 35) is the 'Walking Dead'. Composition matters.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Growth at all costs' and 'Efficient Growth'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation Metric' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\n35 is close to 40. It's not a disaster, just mediocre. Operational tuning (pricing, cost cuts) can fix it.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt's a 'B' grade. Not IPO ready. Needs to either accelerate growth or cut burn to cross the 40 line.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of negative churn. When does a SaaS company achieve it, and how does it affect valuations?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNegative Churn means Expansion Revenue (Upsell/Cross-sell) > Lost Revenue (Churn). Net Revenue Retention (NRR) > 100%. The existing cohort grows in value over time without new sales.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nAchieved by: Usage-based pricing (Snowflake), Seat expansion (Slack), or Multi-product modules (HubSpot). Valuations: Massive premium. It implies 'Uncapped LTV'. The company grows automatically.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Hunter' (Sales) and 'Farmer' (Customer Success) models.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation Driver' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nNegative churn covers the sins of high CAC. You can pay more to acquire because the account grows 140% YoY.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nNegative churn is the 'Holy Grail'. It compounds revenue like interest. Valuations for 120%+ NRR are 2x-3x higher than 90% NRR.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A SaaS startup spends 40% of revenue on S&M. Is this too high, or is it efficient given the growth?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\n40% is standard for high-growth SaaS (Salesforce spent 50% for years). If Growth > 40%, it is justified. S&M is an *investment* in acquiring the annuity stream (ARR), not an expense.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nEfficiency check: Look at CAC Payback. If spend is high but Payback is 6 months, spend *more*. If Payback is 24 months, 40% is toxic burn. The absolute % doesn't matter; the Unit Economics do.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'GAAP Accounting' (Expense) and 'SaaS Physics' (Capex on Customer).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Budgeting' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nFor mature companies, 40% is high. For Series B/C, it is normal. Stop looking at P&L; look at Magic Number.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nEfficient if Magic Number > 0.75. Otherwise, cut S&M and fix the funnel.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze a SaaS startup's payback period for new sales? What is a healthy benchmark?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPayback = CAC / (MRR * Gross Margin). Benchmark: < 12 months for VC funded. < 6 months is elite. > 18 months is dangerous.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCash flow impact: Even with 12 month payback, you have a 'Cash Trough'. Pre-payment (Annual Upfront) reduces the cash payback to 0 (Customer funds the CAC). This is better than monthly billing.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Accounting Payback' and 'Cash Payback'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Cash Flow' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSMB churns faster, so needs faster payback (6-9 mo). Enterprise sticks longer, so can tolerate slower payback (12-18 mo).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAim for 12 months. Incentivize annual prepayments to self-fund growth. Payback is the speed limit of growth.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup has high CAC but also high LTV. Should a VC invest, or is the payback period the limiting factor?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nInvest. High LTV/CAC ratio (e.g., 5x) implies a money printing machine. Payback period is just a 'Working Capital' problem. VC money solves working capital constraints.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nLimiting factor: 'Liquidity constraint'. If Payback is 3 years, you need infinite cash to scale. Also, 'LTV uncertainty'. High LTV relies on long retention predictions (10 years). If tech changes in 5 years, the LTV is fake. CAC is cash out *now*; LTV is hope for *later*.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'theoretical ROI' and 'risk of obsolescence/insolvency'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Investment Thesis' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nHigh CAC implies 'Enterprise Sales'. High barrier to entry. If the startup has a moat, the long payback is a barrier to competitors too.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInvest if retention is proven (low churn). Bridge the cash gap with debt/equity. But discount the LTV for time risk.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"land and expand.\" How would you model the expansion revenue contribution?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLand small (low friction, cheap seat), prove value, then Expand (add seats, cross-sell modules). Reduces initial CAC friction.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nModeling: Use 'Expansion Cohorts'. Assume Year 1 = $10k. Year 2 = $10k (base) + $5k (upsell) - $1k (churn). Net = $14k. Expansion Revenue contribution grows over time, eventually exceeding New Revenue.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Sales Efficiency' (Hunter) and 'Account Management' (Farmer).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Growth Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLand & Expand creates Negative Churn. It requires a product with 'Viral' or 'Network' loops inside the enterprise (e.g., Slack).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel expansion as a % of install base (e.g., 20% upsell). This is the driver of NRR. Without expand, you are on a treadmill.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A SaaS startup is targeting enterprise customers with 6-month sales cycles. How would you model the cash flow impact?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLong cycle = High CAC carrying cost. Sales rep salary paid for 6 months with $0 revenue. Cash burn spikes before revenue arrives. This is the 'J-Curve of Sales'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nImpact: 'Lumpy' cash flow. One big deal makes the quarter. Miss one deal, burn looks terrible. Forecasting is binary/stochastic, not linear.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Predictable Expenses' and 'Volatile Revenue'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Financial Planning' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nEnterprise deals often pay Annual Upfront. This 'Float' offsets the long cycle. Once the flywheel starts, the renewals smooth the cash flow.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nRaise enough cash for 18 months to cover the cycle latency. Hire reps in cohorts to average out the ramp time.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze the quality of recurring revenue vs. one-time revenue?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRecurring (ARR) is valued at 10x-20x. One-time (Services/Setup) is valued at 1x-2x. Recurring compounds; Services do not. Services have lower margins (people cost).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nServices are necessary for 'Onboarding' (Stickiness). High services attach rate might reduce Churn (Quality ARR). But if Services > 20% of revenue, it's a consultancy, not SaaS.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Valuation Multiple' and 'Customer Success'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Revenue Quality' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\n'Fake ARR': Usage fees that fluctuate wildly or non-guaranteed contracts. Treat variable revenue with a lower multiple than contracted subscription.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStrip out services revenue from the valuation multiple. Value ARR only. Use services to fund CAC (breakeven services).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup's NPS (Net Promoter Score) is 60. What does this signal about product quality and future growth?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNPS 60 is excellent (Apple/Tesla territory). Signals high user love. Predicts low churn and high organic referrals (lower CAC). It is a leading indicator of growth.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNPS is subjective. 'Would you recommend' != 'Did you recommend'. Cultural bias (Americans rate higher than Europeans). B2B buyers might hate it but be forced to use it (Lock-in). High NPS with high Churn exists (nice-to-have product).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Sentiment' and 'Action' (Retention).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Product Metric' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nNPS for the *buyer* (CIO) matters more than the *user* (Employee) for renewal, but User NPS drives adoption. Measure both.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\n60 is a great sign, but cross-reference with Retention. High NPS + High Retention = Unicorn.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the relationship between product development cycles and sales cycles in enterprise SaaS.",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nThey must align. Enterprise needs 'Features' (SSO, Compliance, RBAC) before they buy. Sales cycle is blocked by Product roadmap. 'Sales-Led Growth'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nProduct Led Growth (PLG) decouples them. Users adopt the product instantly (Short cycle). Enterprise features are gate-kept for the upgrade. This creates a dual cycle.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Customization' (Closing the deal) and 'Standardization' (Scalable product).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Product Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSales always promises features to close the deal (Vaporware). Product hates this. The 'Gap' creates tech debt.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDon't build custom features for one client. Build generalized features that unlock a *segment*. Sync the roadmap releases with the sales quarter close.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model the impact of price increases on churn and LTV?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPrice up 10%. Revenue per Account (ARPU) up 10%. Churn might rise. Elasticity. If product is sticky, Churn stays flat -> LTV rises 10%. If commodity, Churn spikes -> LTV drops.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nGrandfathering. Usually, price increase applies to *new* customers only. Existing get a legacy rate. This protects churn but slows LTV growth. 'Forced migration' risks a revolt.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Pricing Power' and 'Customer Loyalty'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Pricing Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPrice increases usually *increase* LTV. B2B customers are price inelastic (cost is small vs value). Churn fear is overrated.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel a sensitivity table. If 10% price hike causes < 2% extra churn, do it. Most startups underprice.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A VC investor made a $2M Series A investment in a startup. The company is underperforming, and the Series B requires a 20% down round. Should the VC invest?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. 'Good money after bad'. The thesis failed. The down round signals value destruction. Take the dilution and focus on winners.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. 'Defend the position'. If you don't invest, 'Pay-to-Play' terms might wipe you out (convert to common). You invest to preserve the option value of the Series A. Also, signaling: if insider dumps, the company dies. You invest to save face/reputation.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Portfolio Theory' (Cut losers) and 'Game Theory' (Signaling/Dilution).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Follow-on Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIs the underperformance temporary (Market) or structural (Product)? If structural, let it go. If market, buy the dip (Down round is cheap equity).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInvest pro-rata if the unit economics are still sound. Wash out if the product is broken. Don't invest just to save the markup.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"signaling risk.\" How does a down round affect a startup's momentum and future fundraising?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSignaling: If existing insiders (who know the most) don't lead the next round, outsiders assume something is wrong ('Lemons problem'). A down round signals failure.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nDown rounds can be 'Recapitalizations'. A clean-up of the cap table. If insiders support it heavily, it signals 'Conviction despite price'. Smart money buys distress. It hurts momentum (hiring/morale) more than fundraising if the story is fixed.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Price' and 'Perception'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fundraising Psychology' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nTransparency fixes signaling. 'We were overvalued in 2021, now we are fair. Here is the growth.' Honesty can reset the narrative.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nInsiders must lead the down round to kill the signaling risk. If insiders bail, the company is dead.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup's founders are in conflict about the strategic direction. As a board member, how would you mediate?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBack the CEO. A company needs one vision. Consensus is slow. If the disagreement is fundamental, one founder must go. Board's duty is to the Company, not the friendship.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMediate. Co-founder divorce kills startups. Try to split roles (CEO vs CTO) with clear domains. Maybe the CEO is wrong. Listen to the dissident. Firing a founder causes chaos and vesting disputes.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Unity of Command' and 'Diversity of Thought'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Board Governance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUsually, this is about 'Ego' or 'Burnout', not strategy. Get them a coach. If unresolvable, the Board must decide the winner.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nForce a decision. A bad decision executed in unity is better than no decision in conflict. Support the winner, help the loser exit gracefully.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup needs a bridge loan to extend runway before the Series B closes. How would you structure this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nConvertible Note. Fast, cheap legal. Interest 8%, Discount 20%. Converts into Series B. It rewards the bridge investors for the risk.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). Even faster. No interest, no maturity date. Founder friendly. But investors might demand a 'Valuation Cap' to protect against the Series B price running away.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Investor Protection' (Debt features) and 'Founder Flexibility' (Equity features).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Financing Structure' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf the bridge is 'To Nowhere' (Series B uncertain), structure it as Secured Debt. If 'To Somewhere' (Term sheet imminent), use a SAFE.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUse a Convertible Note with a Cap. It aligns incentives. The Cap ensures the bridge isn't punitively expensive if the Series B valuation explodes.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A founder proposes a pivoting the business model. How would you evaluate this decision as a board member?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nEvaluate 'Sunk Cost' vs 'Opportunity'. Ignore the money spent on the old product. Is the new vision bigger? Does the team have the skills for the pivot? Startups are search engines for business models. Pivots are normal.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIs it a 'Pivot' or 'Giving Up'? Serial pivoting (thrashing) destroys morale and cash. Validate the new thesis with data (customer interviews) before committing the remaining cash.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Persistence' and 'Adaptability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Strategic Decision' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCheck the 'Runway'. A pivot resets the clock. Do you have 18 months of cash for the new idea? If not, you need a bridge or wind down.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nApprove the pivot if the old model is a zero (Zombie). Require a 'Hypothesis Test' plan. If the pivot fails, return capital.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"governance rights\" in VC term sheets. What protections do VCs typically require?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nProtective Provisions (Veto rights). VCs can block: Sale of company, Issuing new shares, Changing board size, Taking debt, Changing business line. Board Seats (Control).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFounders push for 'Control'. Dual-class shares (voting control). VCs accept less governance in 'Hot Deals' (FOMO). In down markets, VCs demand 'Super-Voting' preferences.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Founder Autonomy' and 'Capital Accountability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Term Sheet' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nGovernance matters most when things go wrong. When things go right, no one checks the bylaws.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStandard VC deal: Board control is balanced (2 Founder, 2 VC, 1 Independent). Protective provisions cover major structural changes only, not daily ops.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup is acquiring a competitor. How would you analyze the strategic fit and integration risks?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStrategic Fit: Product gaps filled? Market share consolidation? Talent acqui-hire? Value = 1 + 1 > 2 (Synergies).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIntegration Risk: Culture clash. Tech stack incompatibility (Python vs Java). Distraction. Most startup M&A fails because the acquirer is too immature to digest the target.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Growth via Buy' and 'Growth via Build'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'M&A Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDon't buy for revenue (it churns). Buy for 'Product Acceleration' or 'Eliminating a Threat'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nApprove only if the target is small (tuck-in) or the threat is existential. Ensure retention packages for key target engineers are generous.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A founder wants to hire a family member for a senior role. How would you handle this as a board member?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBlock it. Nepotism is toxic. It destroys meritocracy culture. It makes firing impossible. It creates a conflict of interest.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf the family member is genuinely the best person (rare), maybe. But the optical cost is too high. Unless it's a 'Family Business' (not VC backed), it's a governance failure.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Founder Prerogative' and 'Fiduciary Duty'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Governance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe issue is 'Accountability'. You cannot hold your spouse accountable in a QBR without ruining dinner.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nVeto. Offer to help the family member find a job *elsewhere*. Keep the startup professional.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you evaluate a founder's CEO transition? When should a founder step aside?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStep aside when the company outgrows them. '0 to 1' (Product) is different from '1 to N' (Scale/Management). If the founder can't manage managers, or hates sales, hire a Professional CEO.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFounder-CEOs outperform (Bezos, Gates, Zuckerberg). They have the moral authority and long-term vision. Professional CEOs maximize short-term metrics. Better to 'Coach' the founder than replace them.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'DNA/Soul' and 'Professional Execution'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Leadership' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nBring in a COO (Sheryl Sandberg type) to handle the scaling, let Founder focus on Product/Vision. Replace Founder only if they are toxic or incompetent.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAugment, don't replace. Transition only if the Founder *wants* to leave or is destroying value.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup has multiple term sheets from different VCs at different valuations. How would you advise the founder on the decision?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTake the highest valuation? No. Take the 'Best Partner'. A Tier 1 VC at lower valuation is worth more than Tier 3 at high valuation (Signaling, Network, Hiring).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nValuation matters for dilution. If the gap is huge (2x), take the money. Money is fungible. VCs overrate their 'Value Add'. 'The best value add is a high valuation'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Smart Money' and 'Cheap Capital'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Fundraising Strategy' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCheck the terms (Liquidation Pref, Board control). High valuation often comes with 'Dirty Terms' (Participating Preferred). Clean terms > High Price.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nOptimize for 'Clean Terms' + 'Partner Chemistry'. Valuation is secondary unless the spread is >30%.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"liquidation preferences.\" How do they affect returns to common stockholders?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLiq Pref: Investors get their money back *before* common gets a dime. 1x Non-Participating: Get $ Invested OR % Ownership. 1x Participating: Get $ Invested AND % Ownership (Double dip).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nImpact: In a downside exit (sale < capital raised), Common gets 0. Liq Pref acts as 'Debt'. In a home run, Liq Pref doesn't matter (everyone converts to common). It protects downside.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Downside Protection' and 'Alignment'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Term Sheet' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nParticipating Preferred misaligns incentives (VC wants to sell cheap to double dip; Founder wants to hold). Avoid Participation.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStandard is 1x Non-Participating. Anything higher (2x, Participating) signals distress or greedy VCs. It hurts employee equity value.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A startup is in a hostile acquisition scenario. As a board member, how would you navigate this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFiduciary Duty: Maximize shareholder value. If the offer is high (premium), you must consider it. You cannot block it just because the Founder wants to keep playing.\n</reason>\n<exception>\n'Revlon Duties' (Sale mode) vs 'Unocal' (Defense). If the company is not for sale, the Board can say No (Just Say No defense), arguing that long-term independent value is higher. Founders with voting control can block anything.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Short Term Premium' and 'Long Term Vision'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'M&A Law' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIn private startups, 'Hostile' is rare because buyers need due diligence (Founder cooperation) and team retention (Earnouts). A hostile deal buys an empty shell.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIt's a negotiation. Use the offer to shop the company for a 'White Knight' (Friendly buyer) or leverage a higher price. Don't sue; negotiate.\n</conclusion>"

They might demand exclusive pricing.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nThey have information rights. They know your margins. They can squeeze you on price. 'The investor hat vs the customer hat'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Commercial Partnership' and 'Financial Independence'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Corporate VC' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDon't give them a Board seat. Keep the commercial contract separate from the investment agreement (Side letter). Limit their information rights.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTake the money, but ring-fence the governance. Ensure they don't have a 'ROFR' (Right of First Refusal) on acquisition.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "A startup is struggling to hit milestones, and the VC wants to replace the CEO. How would you approach this?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPerformance issue. The CEO (Founder) is the bottleneck. Replace with a professional. The company is bigger than the founder.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFounder led companies have 'Soul'. Replacing the founder often kills the innovation engine. The team might leave. It is a 'Heart Transplant'. High risk of rejection.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Competence' and 'Culture'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Governance' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nHave the 'The Talk'. Can the Founder move to 'Executive Chairman' or 'CTO'? Preserve the dignity and the vision, change the reporting lines.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nReplace only as a last resort. Try a COO/President first. If replacement is needed, ensure the Founder buys in, or it will be a civil war.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"drag-along\" and \"tag-along\" rights. Why are these important?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDrag-Along: Majority shareholders can force minority to sell in an exit. Prevents a small shareholder (holdout) from blocking a deal. Important for VCs to ensure liquidity.\nTag-Along (Co-Sale): If Majority sells, Minority has the right to join the deal and sell their shares too. Protects minority from being left behind with a new owner.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nFounders hate Drag-Along (loss of control). VCs hate Tag-Along (might limit their liquidity if buyer only wants 51%).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Majority Control' and 'Minority Protection'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Term Sheet' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDrag-along is essential for M&A. Buyers want 100%. Without it, a 1% angel investor can blackmail the deal.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStandard terms. Drag kicks in if >50% of Board and >50% of Shares approve. Tag protects the little guy. Both are necessary hygiene.\n</conclusion>"
