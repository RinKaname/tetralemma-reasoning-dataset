    {
        "Question": "A PE firm acquires a company for $100M with 60% debt ($60M) and 40% equity ($40M). If EBITDA is $15M and interest rates are 5%, what is the leverage ratio and interest coverage?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLeverage Ratio = Debt / EBITDA = $60M / $15M = 4.0x. Interest = $60M * 5% = $3M. Interest Coverage = EBITDA / Interest = $15M / $3M = 5.0x.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nThese are 'Pro Forma' numbers. The debt usually has fees (OID). The EBITDA is 'Adjusted EBITDA' (addbacks). The real leverage might be 5x and coverage 3x. Also, interest rates float (SOFR), so coverage can shrink.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Nominal Ratios' and 'Credit Agreement Definitions'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'LBO Math' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\n4.0x is conservative. 5.0x coverage is healthy. Banks lend up to 6x. The constraint is usually Free Cash Flow conversion, not just coverage.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nRatio 4x, Coverage 5x. This is a very safe LBO structure (standard is 5-6x leverage).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the mechanics of a leveraged buyout (LBO). How does financial leverage amplify returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nLBO replaces Equity with Debt. You put down less cash ($40M vs $100M). If the company grows value to $150M, and debt stays $60M (or pays down), Equity grows to $90M ($150-60). Return = 90/40 = 2.25x. Without leverage, Return = 150/100 = 1.5x.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nLeverage amplifies losses too. If value drops to $60M, Equity = 0. Bankruptcy risk. The return comes from 1. Deleveraging (paying debt with FCF), 2. EBITDA growth, 3. Multiple Expansion.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'ROE Enhancement' and 'Financial Distress Risk'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'PE Theory' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe magic is the tax shield (interest deduction) and the discipline of debt (free cash flow hypothesis). Managers can't waste cash; they must pay the bank.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLeverage reduces the denominator (Equity cheque). As long as ROIC > Cost of Debt, leverage adds value.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has $100M in EBITDA with 4x leverage. The PE firm plans to reduce leverage to 2x within 5 years. What EBITDA growth would be required (assuming debt is paid down with FCF)?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCurrent Debt = $400M. Target Debt/EBITDA = 2x. This depends on FCF generation (Paydown) AND EBITDA growth (Denominator increase). If no paydown, EBITDA must double to $200M. If aggressive paydown, EBITDA can grow less.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTypically, LBOs rely on 50% from growth, 50% from paydown. Assuming $50M paydown/year? Need FCF model. This is a multivariate equation.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Deleveraging via Cash' and 'Deleveraging via Growth'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Financial Modeling' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAssume constant debt (worst case). EBITDA must double (15% CAGR). Assume constant EBITDA (no growth). Debt must halve (pay $200M). Reality is in between.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nUsually implies ~8-10% EBITDA CAGR combined with FCF sweep. 2x leverage reduction is standard LBO base case.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model a management rollover or ratchet? What are the tax implications?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRollover: Management keeps X% of their equity in the NewCo (tax deferred usually). It reduces the PE check. Ratchet: Management gets *more* equity if IRR > 25%. It incentivizes performance.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nTax: Rollover is tax-free (Section 721/351) if structured right. Ratchets are often taxed as Ordinary Income (Compensation) rather than Capital Gains, which hurts. 'Sweet Equity'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Skin in the Game' and 'Liquidity Needs'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Deal Structuring' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nRollover aligns incentives. PE wants mgmt to hurt if the deal fails. 20-30% rollover is standard for CEOs.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel as a 'Source of Funds'. It reduces the Equity Cheque. It is critical for alignment. Don't buy if management wants to cash out 100%.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A target company has operating leases that aren't on the balance sheet. How would you adjust the debt calculation and impact on leverage?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCapitalize the leases. Treat them as Debt (IFRS 16 / ASC 842 now requires this). Add PV of Lease Payments to Debt. Add Rent Expense back to EBITDA (EBITDAR). Recalculate Leverage.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nAdjusted Leverage will be higher. Retail/Airlines are heavily affected. Banks look at 'Rent Adjusted Leverage'. (Debt + 8*Rent) / EBITDAR.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'GAAP Debt' and 'Economic Liabilities'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Accounting' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nLeases are senior to debt (Landlord gets paid before interest). They reduce flexibility. Treat them as Senior Secured Debt.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAlways capitalize leases. The 'Asset Light' model is often 'Debt Heavy' in disguise.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"dividend recaps.\" How do they affect leverage and returns?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDividend Recap: The company borrows *more* money (adds debt) to pay a special dividend to the PE firm. It returns capital to LPs early.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nEffect: Leverage spikes (Risk increases). Equity value (at risk) decreases (De-risking). IRR spikes (early cash flow has high TVM). It is 'taking chips off the table' while keeping the upside.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'LP Liquidity' and 'Company Solvency'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Financial Engineering' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nCreditors hate it (asset stripping). Shareholders love it. It signals the PE firm thinks the exit is far away or uncertain.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nGreat for IRR, bad for credit rating. Do it only if cash flow is robust enough to service the new debt load.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE acquisition includes earnout payments based on future performance. How would you model this in the investment return calculation?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nEarnout is contingent liability. Model it as 'Additional Purchase Price' paid in Year 1/2/3. It increases the Entry Multiple (effectively). It reduces IRR (cash outflow later).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nOr treat it as 'Operating Expense' if tied to employment? No, usually purchase price. If performance targets aren't met, you don't pay. It de-risks the entry. You pay high price only if high EBITDA is real.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Price Certainty' and 'Risk Sharing'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSeller hates earnouts (PE controls the books and can suppress EBITDA). Buyer loves them (financing from future cash flow).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nModel probability-weighted payment. It bridges the 'Valuation Gap'. Without it, deal dies.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze the debt structure of a leveraged company (senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred equity)? What are the covenants?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSenior (Bank Loan): Cheapest, Secured, Amortizing, Maintenance Covenants (Max Leverage). Sub debt (Mezzanine): Higher rate, Unsecured, Bullet, PIK option. Preferred: Equity kicker.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nAnalysis: 'Cost of Capital' vs 'Flexibility'. Senior is cheap but strict. Mezz is expensive but flexible. Covenants: Incurrence (can't raise more debt) vs Maintenance (must keep leverage low).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'WACC Optimization' and 'Operational Freedom'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Structure' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nOptimal structure maximizes tax shield without triggering default costs. In 2021, 'Unitranche' (blended) became popular for speed/simplicity.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nMaximize Senior debt (cheapest). Fill the gap with Mezz. Watch the covenants; they are the tripwires.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has significant off-balance-sheet liabilities (pension obligations, environmental liabilities). How would you adjust the purchase price allocation?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTreat them as Debt. Underfunded Pension = Debt. Environmental Cleanup = Debt. Subtract these from Enterprise Value to get Equity Value. Bid lower.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nThey are 'Soft Debt'. Pensions are long-dated. Cleanup might be negotiated or insured. They don't trigger immediate default like bank debt. But they consume cash flow.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Legal Liability' and 'Cash Flow Timing'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Valuation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nNegotiate an 'Indemnity' or 'Escrow'. Seller covers the liability. Or buy 'Assets' not 'Stock' to leave liabilities behind (if legal).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDeduct 100% of the Net Present Value of these liabilities from the purchase price. Do not inherit a black hole.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"sponsor NPV.\" How does this affect deal pricing?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSponsor NPV? Usually refers to the PE firm's valuation model outcomes? No, likely refers to 'Value to a Financial Sponsor'. PE pays based on LBO math (Target IRR 20%). Strategic pays based on Synergies (DCF).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSponsor pricing is capped by leverage capacity. Price = Max Debt + Equity Check (that solves for 20% IRR). They cannot pay more. Strategics can.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Financial Constraints' and 'Strategic Value'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Deal Pricing' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIf Sponsor NPV > Strategic NPV, the market is broken (cheap credit?) or the Strategic is asleep.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSponsor pricing is a floor. It provides a backstop valuation based on cash flow and leverage.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A target company has seasonal working capital swings. How would you model this in the LBO model?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAverage Working Capital ignores the peak. You must model 'Monthly' cash flows. Ensure the 'Revolver' (Line of Credit) is large enough to fund the peak NWC build (Inventory pre-Christmas).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf you ignore seasonality, you will break liquidity covenants in Q3. The LBO model usually works on Annual basis; Seasonality requires a 'Liquidity Sidecar' model.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Annual Average' and 'Peak Funding Need'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Liquidity Modeling' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSeasonality consumes cash. It is an inefficient use of capital. Try to smooth it (JIT inventory) or factor the revolver interest into the P&L.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSize the Revolver for the Peak, not the Average. Include the 'Clean Down' provision (paying off revolver once a year) in the logic.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you analyze refinancing risk in an LBO? What happens if rates spike?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRefi Risk: The inability to roll over the debt balloon payment at maturity (Year 5-7). Depends on credit markets. If rates spike, Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) drops. The company might become insolvent or FCF turns negative.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMitigation: Ladder maturities. Hedge interest rates (Swaps/Caps). If rates spike, equity value is crushed (higher interest = less debt paydown). But inflation (often correlated with rates) might boost EBITDA.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cheap Variable Rate Debt' and 'Expensive Fixed Rate Security'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Risk Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nIn LBO, the exit *is* the refinancing (for the buyer). If markets are closed, you can't sell. Holding period extends -> IRR drops.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nHedge at least 50% of the floating rate exposure. Don't bet the company on the Fed pivot.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE acquisition includes a seller note (seller financing). How would this affect the return profile?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSeller Note is Junior Debt. It reduces the Equity Check required from the PE firm. Less Equity = Higher IRR (Leverage boost). It also signals Seller confidence.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIt usually has PIK interest (Payment in Kind) or flexible terms. It is 'Friendly Debt'. It bridges the valuation gap. If the deal fails, the Seller is subordinated to the Bank.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Price' and 'Structure'. Higher price with seller note is better than lower price with all cash.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Deal Structuring' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nUse Seller Notes to push leverage beyond bank limits. It is 'Cheap Equity'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAccretive to IRR. Always ask for it. It aligns the seller (who stays involved) with the debt repayment.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you model the tax impact of an LBO on the exit return?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nExit Price - Cost Basis = Gain. Tax on Gain. PE funds (LPs) are often tax-exempt (Pension funds) or pass-through. The tax leakage happens at the *Portfolio Company* level (Corporate Tax) and *Management* level (Carry tax).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nStructuring: Asset Sale vs Stock Sale. Buyers prefer Asset Sale (Step-up basis -> Depreciation tax shield). Sellers prefer Stock Sale (Lower tax rate). LBO exit is usually Stock Sale. Model the 'Inside Basis' vs 'Outside Basis'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Buyer Tax Benefit' and 'Seller Tax Cost'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Tax' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSection 338(h)(10) election allows Stock Sale to be treated as Asset Sale. Creates tax shield for buyer, higher tax for seller. Buyer pays seller to agree.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAssume Stock Sale (Capital Gains). If Asset Sale, calculate the 'Step-up' value. Tax structure drives the net proceeds significantly.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has significant CapEx requirements to maintain operations. How would this affect FCF and deleveraging?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFCF = EBITDA - Interest - Taxes - CapEx - Change in NWC. High CapEx reduces FCF directly. Less FCF = Slower Debt Paydown = Lower IRR. Maintenance CapEx is mandatory.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nGrowth CapEx is discretionary. You can cut it to boost FCF (short term boost), but it kills long term exit value. PE firms often optimize CapEx (Sale-Leasebacks of machines/real estate) to free up cash.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Cash Harvesting' and 'Asset Quality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Cash Flow' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nHeavy CapEx industries (Manufacturing) support less leverage than Light CapEx (Software). The debt capacity is a function of FCF, not EBITDA.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDeduct Maintenance CapEx from EBITDA to get 'EBITDA - Capex' (Proxy for FCF). Leverage off this number, not headline EBITDA.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE-backed company's EBITDA margin is 15%, while competitors are at 20%. How would you identify margin expansion opportunities?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBenchmarking. SG&A analysis. COGS analysis. Procurement savings (bulk buying). Pricing optimization. 5% gap is the 'Value Creation Plan'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMaybe the gap is structural (Scale). Competitor is 10x bigger. Or product mix (Competitor sells software, you sell hardware). Blind cost cutting damages the business. You must identify 'Waste' vs 'Structural Disadvantage'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Operational Efficiency' and 'Strategic Positioning'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Operations' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nZero-Based Budgeting (ZBB). Justify every expense. Often, the fat is in 'Middle Management' or 'Indirect Procurement'.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTarget 20%. Execute '100-day plan'. Pricing is the fastest lever; Cost cutting is the surest.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"operational value creation.\" What are the main levers (pricing, cost reduction, growth)?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nOld PE was 'Financial Engineering' (Leverage). New PE is 'Operational'. Levers: 1. Revenue Growth (Sales force effectiveness, New markets). 2. Margin Expansion (Pricing, COGS, SG&A). 3. Capital Efficiency (Working Capital, Capex).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nGrowth is the most valuable lever (Multiple expansion). Cost cutting is capped (can't cut to zero). Pricing is pure profit. The mix depends on the asset type (Growth vs Turnaround).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Growth' (Requires investment) and 'Margins' (Requires cuts).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Value Creation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe best lever is 'Pricing'. It flows 100% to EBITDA. Most companies underprice.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStart with Pricing (Day 1). Then Cost (Year 1). Then Growth (Year 2-5). Operational improvement drives the multiple.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has sales, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses at 25% of revenue. How would you benchmark and identify reduction opportunities?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBenchmark against public peers (15-20%). Reduction: Headcount (Span of control), IT systems (ERP consolidation), Office footprint, Travel/Entertainment policies. Outsourcing (Back office).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSG&A includes Sales Commission. If you cut Sales spend, you kill Growth. Distinguish between 'G&A' (Overhead - Cut) and 'S&M' (Investment - Optimize). Don't cut muscle.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Leanness' and 'Capability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Cost Cutting' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAutomate G&A (AP/AR). The goal is 'Operating Leverage': Revenue grows, G&A stays flat.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTarget 18%. Focus on non-customer-facing costs first. Automate before you terminate.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you implement pricing increases without losing customers? What pricing strategies would you consider?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStrategies: Inflation indexation (CPI+). Segmentation (Raise price on small/costly customers). Bundling (Add value, raise price). 'Good-Better-Best' tiering. Justify with 'New Features'.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk: Churn. Communicate value, not cost. Test price elasticity. Enterprise customers tolerate hikes better than SMBs. If you haven't raised prices in 5 years, you are leaving money on the table.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Margin' and 'Volume'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Pricing' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'grandfathering' trap. Don't let legacy customers stay on 2010 pricing forever. Lift them to market over 3 years.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nRaise prices annually. It trains the customer. The churn impact is usually minimal compared to the margin gain.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company's customer acquisition cost is rising while churn is increasing. How would you address these issues?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nThis is the 'Death Spiral'. LTV/CAC is collapsing. Address: 1. Fix Churn first (Product issues, Customer Success). 2. Optimize CAC (Kill bad channels, improve conversion). 3. Fire bad customers (unprofitable).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nMaybe the market is saturated. Rising CAC = Competition. Rising Churn = Obsolescence. If structural, pivot or harvest (stop growth, maximize cash).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Growth' and 'Sustainability'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Unit Economics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSegment the data. Maybe 'Enterprise' is healthy, but 'SMB' is toxic. Shut down the SMB funnel. Focus on the healthy segment.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nStop marketing spend immediately. You are pouring water into a leaky bucket. Fix the leak (Churn) before turning the tap (CAC) back on.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"synergies\" in PE deals. How would you identify and underwrite revenue and cost synergies?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCost Synergies (Hard): Headcount reduction (HR/Finance overlap), IT consolidation, Procurement. Revenue Synergies (Soft): Cross-selling products to customer bases. PE deals (Platform + Add-on) rely on synergies.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCost synergies are reliable; Revenue synergies are aspirational (usually fail). Underwriting: Discount Revenue synergies by 50-80%. Count Cost synergies at 80-100% minus 'One-time Costs to Achieve' (Severance/Integration).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Deal Model Optimism' and 'Integration Reality'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'M&A' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nSynergies take time (18 months). Don't model them in Year 1. The 'J-curve' of integration costs comes first.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPay for Cost synergies (if you control them). Treat Revenue synergies as upside options, not base case.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has significant manual processes. How would you evaluate the cost of automation and the payback period?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nCost: Software + Implementation + Training. Benefit: Hours saved * Wage rate. Payback = Cost / Annual Savings. RPA (Robotic Process Automation) allows quick wins.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHidden costs: Maintenance, exceptions handling, culture shock. Automation often reveals 'Process flaws'. You must fix the process *before* automating it ('Paving the cow path').\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Labor Arbitrage' (Offshoring) and 'Tech Arbitrage' (Automation).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Digital Transformation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nAutomation improves *Quality* and *Speed*, not just Cost. The error reduction value might exceed the labor savings.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf Payback < 2 years, do it. Focus on high-volume, repetitive tasks (AP processing).\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you implement supply chain optimization in a PE-backed company?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nConsolidate vendors (Volume discount). Optimize inventory (JIT). Re-bid logistics contracts. SKU rationalization (kill long tail products).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRisk: Resilience. Single-sourcing saves money but risks stockouts (COVID lesson). JIT is fragile. Optimization must balance 'Efficiency' and 'Robustness'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Working Capital' and 'Supply Security'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Operations' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nWorking Capital release (Inventory reduction) is 'One-time Cash Flow'. It funds the equity check. It is a massive value driver.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAttack Working Capital. Reduce DPO (pay slower), collect faster (DSO). It's free money.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A company has excess inventory. How would you optimize working capital without disrupting operations?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nDiscount/Liquidation of obsolete stock (cash gen). Improved demand forecasting. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI). Consignment.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nLiquidation hurts gross margin and brand. Operations fear stockouts (hoarding). You need 'Safety Stock' logic based on volatility, not gut feel.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Liquidity' (Cash) and 'Service Level' (Availability).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Working Capital' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nExcess inventory hides quality problems. Lean inventory exposes them. The cleanup is painful but necessary.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nSell the old stuff. Stop buying the slow stuff. Cash is better than dust-gathering boxes.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "Explain the concept of \"same-store sales\" growth. How would this differ from overall revenue growth?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nSSS (Like-for-Like) measures organic growth from existing assets (stores open > 1 year). Overall growth includes 'New Store Openings'. SSS measures brand health; Overall measures expansion.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIf SSS is negative but Overall is positive, you are 'Buying Growth' via Capex. This is a Ponzi dynamics (eventually you run out of locations). SSS must be > Inflation.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Organic Health' and 'Imperial Expansion'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Retail Metrics' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nDecompose SSS: Price vs Volume. If SSS is up on Price but Volume is down, you are alienating customers. Volume growth is the truth.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nFocus on SSS. Expansion is easy; SSS is hard. PE pays for SSS potential.\n</conclusion>"

    {
        "Question": "A company's net working capital is 20% of revenue. Is this excessive, and how would you reduce it?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nBenchmark against industry (usually 10-15%). 20% implies trapped cash. Reduce by: Stretcing Payables (DPO), Chasing Receivables (DSO), Shrinking Inventory (DIO). Cash Conversion Cycle optimization.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSome industries (Distributors) have high NWC. Reducing it might lose suppliers or customers. Aggressive collection hurts relationships. Aggressive payment stretching risks supply chain.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Balance Sheet Efficiency' and 'Commercial Relationships'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Cash Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nEvery dollar released from NWC is a dollar of Debt paid down. It increases Equity value 1:1. It is the highest ROI activity in PE.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nTarget 15%. Implement strict policies. Incentivize managers on 'Return on Capital', not just Sales.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "How would you evaluate a company's vendor contracts? What renegotiation opportunities exist?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nConsolidate spend. If you have 10 IT providers, pick 1 and demand 20% off. RFQ (Request for Quote) everything. Standardize payment terms (Net 60).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSwitching costs. Risk of service disruption. Vendor goodwill. Sometimes paying more for a strategic partner is worth it (innovation access).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Procurement Savings' and 'Strategic Partnership'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Cost Optimization' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPE firms have 'Group Purchasing Organizations' (GPO). They leverage the spending power of the *entire portfolio* to get discounts (e.g., Shipping, Insurance, Software).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nLeverage the Portfolio scale. Renegotiate everything upon change of control. Vendors expect it.\n</conclusion>"
    },
    {
        "Question": "A PE firm is considering add-on acquisitions to a platform company. How would you evaluate the financial impact?",

Revenue synergies (cross-sell).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nIntegration risk. 'Indigestion'. Culture clash. If you buy 5 add-ons, you might create a frankenstein mess of IT systems. The arbitrage only works if you *integrate* them.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Multiple Arbitrage' and 'Operational Complexity'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Buy and Build' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe 'Roll-up' strategy is a PE staple. It creates scale equity value from small private assets.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAccretive deals are good. But ensure the Platform has the 'Infrastructure' to plug in the add-ons. Don't buy if the Platform is broken.\n</conclusion>"

If one company solves a problem, copy the solution to the other 14.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCompanies are different. 'Cookie Cutter' approaches fail. A SaaS sales playbook doesn't work for Manufacturing.
