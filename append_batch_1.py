        "Question": "You manage a Private Equity fund. You acquired a manufacturing firm for 10x EBITDA using 70% leverage. Two years later, EBITDA is flat, and interest rates have doubled, crushing your coverage ratios. Do you inject more equity to pay down debt or force a restructuring?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStandard PE logic suggests injecting equity (curing the default) to preserve the option value of the equity. Walking away destroys your firm's reputation with lenders for future deals, and 'extending the runway' allows time for a turnaround or macro improvement.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHowever, the 'Sunk Cost Fallacy' warns against throwing good money after bad. If the core business is cyclical and entering a downturn, injecting equity merely transfers wealth from your LPs to the lenders without solving the solvency issue. A restructuring (swapping debt for equity) might be the only way to right-size the capital structure, even if it wipes out the current vintage's carry.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThere is a tension between 'Reputation Capital' (preserving relationships with lenders) and 'Fiduciary Duty' (not wasting LP capital on zombie firms). The PE firm's incentives (management fees on deployed capital) may diverge from the LPs' desire for ROI.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Distressed Asset Management' dilemma involving Capital Structure optimization and Game Theory with creditors.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary choice assumes the lenders want to own the keys. In reality, lenders are often 'loan-to-own' funds or traditional banks. If banks, they may prefer 'amend and extend' (kicking the can) rather than taking a write-down. The solution lies in negotiating a waiver fee or PIK (Payment in Kind) interest toggle rather than a pure equity injection or bankruptcy.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nThe decision depends on the 'Fulcrum Security' position. If the equity is deeply out of the money, force a restructuring. If the firm is cash-flow positive but purely choked by interest expense, negotiate a PIK toggle to weather the rate cycle without diluting LPs further.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a VC investor in a Series B SaaS company. The company has 6 months of cash left and growth has stalled. A competitor offers an acqui-hire deal that returns 1x capital to investors but nothing to common stock (founders/employees). Do you block the deal to push for a 'Hail Mary' pivot?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFiduciary duty to your LPs suggests taking the 1x return. In Venture Capital, capital preservation is the second best outcome to a home run. Blocking the deal risks a total zero (bankruptcy) in 6 months. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHowever, VCs operate on a 'Power Law' curve where 1x returns are irrelevant to the fund's overall success; only 10x+ matters. Blocking the deal to force a pivot creates a small probability of a massive outcome (positive asymmetry), whereas the sale caps the upside at a meaningless level for the fund model. Furthermore, screwing the founders destroys your brand in the founder community.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis creates a tension between 'Financial Rationality' (maximizing Expected Value of this specific asset) and 'Portfolio Strategy' (swinging for fences). It also highlights the misalignment between Preferred Stock (investors) and Common Stock (employees).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Principal-Agent' conflict within Corporate Governance and Venture Capital Strategy.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe conflict assumes a zero-sum game between investors and founders. A 'Carve-out' or 'Management Carve-out' plan can be structured where the investors give up a portion of their liquidation preference to create a bonus pool for the founders/employees, aligning incentives for the sale.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nYou should approve the deal *conditional* on a recut of the proceeds. Blocking a deal when the company is failing is structurally irresponsible, but taking 100% of the proceeds while leaving founders with zero is reputationally suicidal. The 'Carve-out' is the necessary synthesis.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are the CFO of a mature industrial conglomerate. Your stock is trading at a P/E of 8x, historically low. Activist investors are demanding you cut R&D to fund a massive share buyback. Do you comply?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFinancial theory (Modigliani-Miller) implies that if the stock is undervalued, buybacks are the best allocation of capital. Accreting EPS by retiring cheap shares directly benefits shareholders. R&D is uncertain and long-term; buybacks are immediate and certain.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHowever, cutting R&D in an industrial firm is essentially liquidation in slow motion. If you stop innovating, your terminal value approaches zero. The low P/E might be a signal that the market *already* expects your products to become obsolete. Boosting short-term EPS at the expense of long-term competitiveness is 'short-termism' that destroys intrinsic value.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is the tension between 'Short-Term Stock Price Performance' (shareholder primacy) and 'Long-Term Corporate Sustenance' (stakeholder theory). It pits the financial engineer against the product engineer.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Capital Allocation' problem focusing on Corporate Governance and Valuation.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe choice is false because buybacks and R&D are not always mutually exclusive. The constraint is usually free cash flow. If the company is over-levered or inefficient, operational improvements (cutting fat, not muscle) should fund the buyback. If the R&D yield is lower than the cost of capital, it *should* be cut regardless of the buyback.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not cut *productive* R&D. Execute a buyback using debt (if under-levered) or divestiture of non-core assets. If the activists insist on gutting the core business, you must resist, as the P/E expansion from R&D success (multiple expansion) far outweighs the EPS bump from financial engineering.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You manage a Global Macro Hedge Fund. You believe the Japanese Yen (JPY) will collapse due to the yield curve control gap. Do you short JPY immediately?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nFundamental analysis screams short. The interest rate differential between the US (5%) and Japan (0%) makes holding JPY painful (negative carry), and the BOJ cannot print money forever to suppress yields without devaluing the currency. The trade has positive expected value.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHowever, this is the 'Widowmaker' trade. The BOJ has infinite firepower to intervene in the short term. Timing is everything. Entering the trade too early means bleeding to death on the carry (cost of borrowing Yen) before the collapse happens. 'The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.'\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThere is a tension between 'Fundamental Truth' (economic gravity) and 'Market Timing/Liquidity' (technical reality). Being right theoretically is irrelevant if you are stopped out financially.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Market Microstructure' and 'Risk Management' problem in International Finance.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary 'Short vs Wait' ignores the convexity of options. Instead of shorting the spot currency (linear risk), you should buy deep out-of-the-money put options on the Yen. This limits your downside to the premium paid (no margin calls) while retaining unlimited upside if the peg breaks.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not short the spot market immediately. Construct a 'convex' position using options to define your risk. The timing of a sovereign debt/currency crisis is politically determined, not just economically determined.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are the CEO of a pre-revenue Biotech startup. You have successful Phase 1 trial data. A Big Pharma company offers to license the drug for $20M upfront + royalties, or you can raise Series B to fund Phase 2 yourself. What do you do?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nGo big. Phase 1 success de-risks the asset. Raising Series B allows you to retain 100% of the asset's value. If Phase 2 is successful, the valuation jumps 10x. Licensing now gives away the lion's share of the future value to the Pharma partner.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHowever, the 'Binary Risk' in biotech is extreme. Phase 2 trials have a high failure rate. If you fail, the company is worth zero. The licensing deal locks in a win, validates the technology, and provides non-dilutive capital to fund *other* pipeline assets. It transforms a binary gamble into a sustainable platform company.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Value Maximization' (Retaining equity) and 'Risk Mitigation' (Offloading binary risk). It asks if you are a 'Drug Developer' (one product) or a 'Biotech Company' (portfolio of products).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Strategic Partnership' decision in the Life Sciences sector, involving Real Options analysis.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe choice depends on your pipeline depth. If this is your *only* asset, licensing is safer but caps upside. If you have a platform technology, licensing the *first* asset validates the platform, making it easier to raise capital for the *second* asset at a higher valuation.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf you are a single-asset company, take the Series B and bet on yourself (high risk/high reward). If you are a platform company, license the drug to prove the platform works, then use the non-dilutive capital to self-fund the next assets. Context of the 'Pipeline' dictates the strategy.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Real Estate Developer. You can build a LEED Platinum 'Green' office building for a 20% premium in construction costs. Rents for green buildings are only 5% higher. Do you build it Green?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nPure DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis says no. The 20% upfront Cost CapEx is not justified by a meager 5% yield increase. The NPV (Net Present Value) of the green project is lower than the standard project. Maximize ROI by building to code, not above it.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nHowever, Cap Rate compression is real. Institutional investors (Pension Funds, Sovereign Wealth) have strict ESG mandates. They will pay a significantly lower Cap Rate (higher price) for a Green building upon exit. The value isn't in the *rent* (cash flow), it's in the *exit multiple* (asset value).\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Operating Yield' (Cash on Cash return) and 'Terminal Value' (Capital Appreciation). It reflects the disconnect between tenant willingness to pay vs. investor willingness to pay.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Real Estate Valuation' problem involving ESG premiums and Exit Strategies.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe analysis changes if you consider the 'Obsolescence Risk'. Non-green buildings may face 'Brown Discounts' or regulatory fines in 10 years, becoming stranded assets. The Green premium is an insurance policy against future regulation.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBuild Green if your strategy is 'Merchant Build' (sell to institutions upon completion) because they value the badge. Build Standard if your strategy is 'long-term hold' and your local market tenants are price-sensitive. The 'Exit Partner' dictates the spec.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You manage a $1B Endowment. The Investment Committee wants to divest from all Fossil Fuel companies for ethical reasons. These companies are currently paying high dividends and trading at low multiples. Do you support divestment?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nNo. Fiduciary duty requires maximizing risk-adjusted returns. Excluding an entire sector (Energy) reduces diversification and historically lowers returns. Fossil fuel companies are currently cash cows. Divestment is 'virtue signaling' that doesn't actually hurt the companies (someone else buys the stock).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nYes. 'Stranded Asset' theory suggests that reserves of oil/coal are overvalued because climate regulation will prevent them from ever being burned. The market is mispricing this long-tail risk. Divesting is not just ethical; it's a prudent avoidance of a sector facing secular terminal decline.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Modern Portfolio Theory' (Diversification is a free lunch) and 'Thematic Investing' (Sectoral headwinds). It clashes Fiduciary Duty (profit) with Social Responsibility (ethics).\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is an 'ESG Investing' dilemma within Asset Allocation and Fiduciary Law.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary 'Divest vs Invest' misses the strategy of 'Engagement'. By retaining shares, the endowment keeps voting rights to force the companies to transition to renewables (Engine No. 1 strategy). Divesting loses your seat at the table.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not divest if the goal is *change*; use voting power. Support divestment if the goal is *risk management* against stranded assets, but acknowledge it as an active bet against the sector, not just a moral stance. The decision must be framed as 'Risk Management', not 'Politics', to satisfy the charter.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are the Founder of a high-growth consumer app. You have 51% of the voting shares. A new investor offers $100M but demands a Board seat and protective provisions that effectively give them veto power over the budget. Do you take the money?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTake the money. $100M is a war chest that allows you to crush competitors. Giving up some control is standard in late-stage growth equity. 'Control' is an illusion if you run out of cash.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRefuse. 'Protective Provisions' on the budget mean they can starve your strategy if they disagree with your spending. Retaining 51% equity is useless if the Board contractually blocks your ability to execute. You are trading sovereignty for capital, potentially turning yourself into an employee in your own company.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Capital Availability' (Resource abundance) and 'Operational Autonomy' (Strategic freedom). It questions whether the Founder or the Capital is the primary driver of value.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Corporate Governance' and 'Term Sheet Negotiation' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary is false. You can negotiate the *scope* of the veto. Limit the budget veto to only apply if burn rate exceeds X% variance, or if cash balance falls below Y months. This protects the investor's downside without handicapping the founder's daily execution.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not accept a blanket budget veto. Negotiate 'Guardrails' instead of 'Gatekeepers'. If they refuse, the capital is too expensive in terms of control. Governance rights are often more expensive than the valuation headline.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Merger Arbitrageur. Company A is buying Company B for $50/share (Cash). Company B trades at $48. The spread is 4%. The antitrust regulator (FTC) has signaled concerns. Do you put on the trade?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. A 4% spread for a deal closing in 3 months is a 16% annualized return. The market is overreacting to the regulatory noise. Most deals eventually close, possibly with some divestitures. The risk/reward is favorable.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. The 'Khan/antitrust' era has changed the regime. Regulators are suing to block deals to set precedents, not just to fix markets. If the deal breaks, Company B drops to its undisturbed price of $30. You are risking $18 to make $2. This is 'picking up pennies in front of a steamroller'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Statistical Arbitrage' (Historical deal close rates) and 'Regime Shift' (Political antitrust changes). The past data regarding deal breaks may not predict the future political environment.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Event-Driven Strategy' problem involving Legal Risk and Asymmetric Payoffs.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe risk is not binary (Close vs Break). The risk is 'Duration'. Even if the deal closes, a lawsuit could delay it by 18 months, destroying your IRR (Internal Rate of Return). A 4% absolute return over 18 months is a losing trade against the cost of capital.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPass on the trade unless the spread widens significantly (e.g., to $45). The current 4% spread does not compensate for the 'Duration Risk' of a protracted legal battle, even if you believe the deal will ultimately close legally. In Arb, time is the enemy.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a CFO. You have $100M in offshore cash that would face a high repatriation tax if brought home. You need $100M domestically for a dividend. Do you borrow locally (issue debt) or repatriate the cash and pay the tax?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nIssue debt. Interest payments are tax-deductible, creating a tax shield. Repatriating cash triggers an immediate, irreversible tax bill. It is inefficient to pay a 20%+ tax penalty when you can borrow at 5% (net of tax shield).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nRepatriate. If the company is already highly levered, adding more debt affects your credit rating and raises the cost of capital for the *entire* firm. Furthermore, 'trapped cash' offshore is discounted by equity analysts. Bringing it back cleans up the balance sheet and simplifies the narrative.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Tax Efficiency' (P&L optimization) and 'Balance Sheet Health' (Credit rating/Leverage ratios). It pits the Tax Department against the Treasury Department.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'International Tax Planning' and 'Capital Structure' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe solution involves a 'Synthetic Repatriation'. You can use the offshore cash as collateral for a loan, or engage in a currency swap. However, Section 956 (Deemed Repatriation) rules make this hard. The real pivot is whether you have *offshore uses* for the cash (e.g., acquiring a foreign rival). If not, the cash is a dragging anchor.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf the domestic interest rate is lower than the tax impact *and* you have leverage capacity, borrow. This was the 'Apple Strategy' of the 2010s. Only repatriate if a 'Tax Holiday' is politically imminent or if leverage covenants are tight.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "You are a Value Investor. A company trades at 0.5x Book Value. It has declining revenues but sits on valuable real estate recorded at 1990 cost basis. Do you buy?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. This is a classic 'Net-Net' or deep value play. The market is pricing it for bankruptcy. Even if the business dies, the liquidation value of the real estate exceeds the market cap. You are buying a dollar for 50 cents.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. This is a 'Value Trap'. The management has no incentive to liquidate the real estate because they would lose their jobs. They will burn the real estate value to subsidize the failing operating business until both reach zero. 'Assets are only worth what management is willing to do with them.'\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Asset Value' (Balance Sheet) and 'Governance Reality' (Agency Costs). The hidden asset is real, but the catalyst to unlock it is missing.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Deep Value Investing' problem involving Corporate Governance and Catalyst identification.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe trade only works if you can be an *activist*. If you just buy the stock, you are a passive victim. If you can buy enough to force a board seat or a sale-leaseback transaction, you can unlock the value.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBuy only if there is an 'Activist Catalyst' or if you intend to be one. Passive value investing in melting ice cubes is a losing strategy. The value is theoretical; the cash burn is actual.\n</conclusion>"

You can tune it to flag only 1% of legitimate users, but this will let more actual fraud through (False Negatives). Do you relax the filter?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRelax the filter. Growth is the priority. Blocking 5% of good customers insults them and drives them to competitors (high churn). Losing a customer lifetime value (LTV) is far more expensive than absorbing a small amount of fraud loss. Optimize for User Experience (UX).\n</reason>\n<exception>\nKeep it strict. Fraud is not just a financial cost; it's an existential risk. If you let money launderers or fraudsters through, you lose your banking license or face massive regulatory fines (KYC/AML). The cost of a regulatory shutdown is infinite.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Growth/UX' (Customer Acquisition) and 'Compliance/Risk' (Platform Survival).

        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. High revenue growth suggests product-market fit. Venture debt is senior to equity. In a downside scenario, you get paid first. The high churn is just a symptom of early scaling; they can fix the leaky bucket later.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. 30% churn implies the product is not sticky. They are 'buying revenue' to show growth. Once the equity funding dries up, the growth will stop, and the churn will hollow out the company instantly. You are lending against a 'house of cards'.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Top-Line Momentum' (Growth) and 'Unit Economics' (Retention/Sustainability). Lenders care about downside protection, which depends on stickiness, not just growth.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Credit Risk Analysis' problem in Venture Finance.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe decision depends on the 'Cohort Analysis'. Is the churn coming from older vintage cohorts (product failure) or just bad acquisition targeting in new cohorts?

        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. A 2% real yield (12% - 10%) is attractive in a zero-rate world. The export boom provides hard currency reserves to service the debt. The yield compensates for the political risk.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. 'Populism' implies fiscal irresponsibility. The export boom is cyclical. When commodity prices crash, the country will be left with bloated social spending and no revenue, leading to hyperinflation or default. The 12% yield is a 'trap' that doesn't cover the currency devaluation risk.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Carry Trade' (Yield seeking) and 'Macro-Political Risk'.

If the bond is in Local Currency, you risk inflation/devaluation. If it is in US Dollars (Eurobond), you risk default. The populist government is more likely to inflate away local debt than default on hard currency debt (initially).\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nBuy only if it is a 'Hard Currency' bond and the maturity is short (within the commodity cycle).

Switching to Mexico erodes your net profit and forces you to raise prices, losing market share.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nSwitch to Mexico. The 'Total Cost of Ownership' includes risk.

Your job is to make the model work so the deal gets done and fees are generated. If you kill the deal, you might kill your career.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nUse 10x. 'Multiple Expansion' is not a strategy; it's luck. Prudent investing requires assuming 'Multiple Compression' over time. If the deal only works at 12x, it has no margin of safety. Presenting a fragile deal to the IC is a violation of intellectual honesty.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Deal Momentum/Incentives' (Getting the deal done) and 'Investment Discipline' (Capital protection). It reflects the agency problem in PE firms.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Financial Modeling' and 'Professional Ethics' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nPresent a sensitivity table. Show the IRR at 10x, 12x, and 14x. Let the IC make the call on the assumption. Do not hardcode 12x; expose the sensitivity of the return to the exit multiple. If the IRR drops to 5% at a 10x exit, the deal is structurally flawed.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nPresent the Base Case with the 12x (standard) but highlight the 'Downside Case' at 10x. If the deal relies entirely on the exit multiple to generate return (rather than deleveraging or EBITDA growth), it is a speculation, not an LBO.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "You are a Crypto Fund Manager. You hold a large position in a DeFi protocol that has just been hacked. The price is crashing. The protocol team proposes a 'hard fork' to roll back the chain and recover funds. Do you vote Yes?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nVote Yes. The hack was theft. Recovering the funds saves the investors and the project. 'Code is Law' should not mean 'Theft is Legal'. Pragmatism dictates saving the ecosystem.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nVote No. The core value proposition of crypto is 'Immutability'. If you roll back the chain every time something goes wrong, it is just a centralized database. A bailout destroys the long-term credibility of the system for a short-term financial fix. You must accept the loss to preserve the ethos.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Short-Term Solvency' (Restitution) and 'Long-Term Credibility' (Immutability). It is the 'DAO Hack' Ethereum Classic dilemma.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Governance' and 'Philosophy of Money' problem in Crypto.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe decision depends on the 'Decentralization Theater'. If the project is already centralized (multisig keys), the fork changes nothing about the reality. If it claims to be decentralized, the fork proves it is a lie.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nIf the protocol is early-stage/experimental, vote Yes (survival mode). If it is a Layer-1 aspiring to be global money, vote No (immutability is the product). Financial recovery cannot come at the cost of the system's foundational axiom.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a CEO. You can use AI to automate 30% of your workforce, boosting margins significantly. However, these are loyal employees who built the company. Do you fire them?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nYes. A CEO's duty is to the shareholders and the survival of the firm. If you don't automate, your competitors will, and they will undercut your prices. Eventually, the whole company will go bankrupt, and everyone loses their jobs. Automation is inevitable.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nNo. A company is a community, not just a cash flow stream. Firing 30% of the staff destroys morale ('Survivor Syndrome') and culture. The remaining employees will work in fear, stifling innovation. The reputational damage will make hiring talent impossible in the future.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Economic Efficiency' (Profit maximization) and 'Social Contract' (Employee welfare). It is the core conflict of the AI transition.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Business Ethics' and 'Change Management' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe binary 'Fire vs Keep' is lazy. The solution is 'Up-skilling'. Use the AI productivity gains to expand output/services, moving the displaced workers to higher-value roles. If the pie grows, you don't need to cut slices.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nAutomate, but do not fire immediately. Reinvest the margin gains into growth and retraining. Only reduce headcount via natural attrition. The goal is to increase 'Revenue per Employee', not just decrease 'Cost per Employee'.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are an M&A Banker. Your client wants to buy a competitor. You know the competitor has a toxic culture and hidden liabilities (though not legally disclosable). The deal fee is $10M. Do you advise against the deal?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nAdvise against it. You are a 'Trusted Advisor'. If the deal destroys value, your client will blame you later. Protecting the client's long-term interest builds a relationship worth more than one transaction fee.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nStay silent and execute. Your role is 'Execution', not 'Management Consultant'. You are paid to get the deal done. Culture is subjective. If you kill the deal, the client will just go to another bank, pay them the $10M, and you lose the fee and the relationship.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Fiduciary Responsibility' (Best advice) and 'Incentive Structure' (Success fees). Bankers are paid on closing, not on post-merger integration success.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Professional Ethics' and 'Principal-Agent' problem in Investment Banking.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe middle path is 'Disclosure'. You don't have to kill the deal; you have to 'Price the Risk'. Advise the client to lower the bid or increase the escrow holdback to account for integration risk. Let the price reflect the toxicity.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nDo not kill the deal explicitly, but restructure it. Advise a lower price or strict indemnities. This fulfills your duty to warn without rejecting the mandate. If the client proceeds anyway, you have done your job.\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Central Banker. Inflation is high (8%) but the economy is entering a recession. Do you raise rates?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nRaise rates. The Central Bank's primary mandate is Price Stability. Inflation is a regressive tax that hurts the poor most. You must crush inflation expectations, even if it causes a recession (The Volcker Shock). Pain now is better than hyperinflation later.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nCut rates (or pause). Raising rates in a recession is pro-cyclical suicide. It will cause mass unemployment and debt defaults. The inflation might be 'Supply Side' (energy shock), which rates cannot fix. You are killing the patient to cure the fever.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Monetary Discipline' (Fighting inflation) and 'Economic Growth' (Fighting unemployment). It is the 'Stagflation' dilemma.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Macroeconomic Policy' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe decision depends on the 'Anchor'. If inflation expectations are unanchored (wage-price spiral), you *must* hike. If inflation is transient/supply-driven, you look through it. Credibility is the only asset a Central Bank has.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nHike rates until inflation breaks. A recession is a cyclical correction; entrenched inflation is a structural rot. You must sacrifice the short-term economy to save the currency. 'The mandate is price stability, not market stability.'\n</conclusion>"

        "Question": "You are a Portfolio Manager. You have a high-conviction long position. It drops 20% on no news. Do you stop out?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nStop out. 'The market knows something you don't.' Price action is information. Respect the stop-loss to preserve capital. 'Losers average losers.'\n</reason>\n<exception>\nBuy more. If the thesis hasn't changed, the asset is simply on sale. The market is inefficient in the short run. Selling just because the price dropped is 'Weak Hands' behavior. High conviction means exploiting volatility.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Technical Discipline' (Risk management) and 'Fundamental Conviction' (Value investing). It asks if you trust the Price or the Thesis.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Trading Psychology' and 'Risk Management' problem.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe answer depends on 'Position Sizing'. If the position is 2% of the fund, you can buy more. If it is 20% of the fund, you must trim to manage the risk of ruin. The price drop changes the *risk profile* of the portfolio even if the *thesis* is valid.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nReview the thesis. If *nothing* has changed fundamentally, hold or add (if size permits). If there is even a hint that the 'no news' is actually 'leaked bad news', exit. In absence of information, respect the price trend.\n</deconstruction>"

        "Question": "You are a SaaS Founder. You can sell a multi-year contract to a huge Enterprise client, but they demand custom features that don't fit your roadmap. Do you take the deal?",
        "Reasoning": "<reason>\nTake the deal. Revenue is validation. A marquee logo helps close other deals. Cash upfront funds development. You can figure out the roadmap later.\n</reason>\n<exception>\nReject the deal. This is 'Consultingware', not software. Building custom features creates 'Technical Debt' and forks your codebase. You become a dev shop for one client rather than a scalable product company. It ruins your margins and slows down the core product.\n</exception>\n<tension>\nThis is a tension between 'Short-Term Revenue' (Sales) and 'Long-Term Scalability' (Product Strategy). It is the 'Service Trap'.\n</tension>\n<categorization>\nThis is a 'Product Strategy' and 'Business Model' dilemma.\n</categorization>\n<deconstruction>\nThe solution is 'Configuration, not Customization'. Build the requested features *if and only if* they are generalized enough to be sold to other customers. If it is truly one-off, charge 10x Professional Services fees to dissuade them or fund a separate team.\n</deconstruction>\n<conclusion>\nReject the custom features if they diverge from the core vision. Taking the deal turns you into an Agency. Only accept if the 'Customization' can be productized into the core platform.\n</conclusion>"
